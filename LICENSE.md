Each image and work shall be noted individually.

GENERALLY SPEAKING...............

1. If it's my writing, don't quote me for commercial projects without contacting me for permission. It's really weird when businesses take your work and you don't even know. If it's for personal projects, quote me all you like, but at least give me credit. I'm not really that particular otherwise.

2. If it's my PERSONAL ART, then all rights are reserved. Don't use it. Or, if you really want to use it, at least ask me about it. I'll prolly say no, but you can ask.

3. If it's SD art, then it's released under their terms. It'd be nice if you credited me but terms are terms.

4. If it's an art prompt or example, obviously, I'm making a tutorial so everyone can use it and I'm usually making stuff for the public domain, or at least creative commons. It would be nice if you gave me credit once but really...who cares?

5. Feel free to link any parts of my document. IDK. Or, again, if you want to add a section or something to your work, just ask. Really. Even if it's commercial, I don't really care. I just want to be ASKED. I'm just here to make things for people and for people to benefit. I'm just doing it because I enjoy helping people.
