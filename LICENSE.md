GENERALLY SPEAKING...............

1. If it's my writing, don't quote me for commercial projects without contacting me for permission. If it's for personal projects, quote me all you like, but at least give me credit.

2. If it's my PERSONAL ART, then all rights are reserved. Don't use it.

3. If it's SD art, then it's released under their terms. It'd be nice if you credited me.

4. If it's an art prompt or example, obviously, I'm making a tutorial so everyone can use it and I'm usually making stuff for the public domain, or at least creative commons, just give me credit and who cares.

5. Feel free to link any parts of my document. IDK. Or, again, if you want to add a section or something to your work, just ask. Really. Even if it's commercial, I don't really care. I just want to be ASKED. I'm just here to make things for people and for people to benefit. I'm not doing it for money; I'm just doing it because I enjoy helping people.
