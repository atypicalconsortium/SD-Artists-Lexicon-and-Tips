NOTICE: 


* Still working on optimizing the document. 
   * Honestly, this seems to be an ongoing process, RIP. 
   * So sorry if it still takes awhile to load.
* I am done for the samplers for this document. 
   * That means you can already view most of the images already.
   * If you have questions about anything I have made, you can just ask me about it until I post stuff, etc. Just ping me and I’ll try to respond when I can. I’m just a hermit and I’m always on DnD but when I’m available, I’ll try to help.
   * Also, a lot of people have posted amazing samples of stuff with samplers in #community-research, so I would recommend looking at those images, too, if you need more image references!
* THINGS ARE BEING MOVED OVER TO MY VOL 2 DOCUMENT.
   * This includes things regarding using Blender, Unreal Engine, etc.
   * I will also probably move over the art history and architecture, if only so it can be expanded.
   * If you can’t find something that you couldn’t find previously, please check out Volume 2.
* AS SD CHANGES GRADUALLY…        
   * Sections that are out of date won’t be changed.
      * Rather I will try to mark them as I write them so that you know beforehand.
   * So if I’ve written something, and it’s not correct, or accurate now, please do keep that in mind. It might simply be depreciated!
* IF YOU’RE CONFUSED….
   * View my carrd.

QUICK FOREWARD:        


        Hello everyone! My name is Atypical Consortium, but you can just call me AT or Atypical. Welcome to my haphazard, all-encompassing guide to help non-artists and artists alike to use SD in functional, creating, and interesting ways. It’s meant to be used as a one-stop-shop visual and textual guide, and includes information on how to create and generate excellent prompts, pitfalls to avoid, information and expert advice from community members, tutorials, and so much more!
        To navigate the document, please see the outline to the left, or see the table of contents. You can also navigate via the table of contents.
        Github is/will house all of my additional content, which I will point to throughout the document, as necessary.


A WORD OF WARNING:        


PLEASE note the following information before proceeding: 


* I have several rare diseases, including Lupus/Reynauds/SFSN/carpal and cubital tunnel, and if you haven’t guessed, ADHD and more!
   * Due to this, I often write via mobile, which leads to a lot of spelling/grammar errors. I don't use autocorrect because it just makes things harder for me. (That is why I am always misspelling things.) If something is spelled wrong, doesn't make sense, etc, odds are, I will fix it on PC later. 
   *  If it's there for a long time or a link is wrong, feel free to hit me up, though. Or if something doesn't make any sense, let me know so I can make this easier; I am open to feedback.
   * If I don’t respond in a few days or hours, feel free to bother me again. I may simply be out at a doctor’s appointment, or simply forgot to reply.
* The art history section does contain nudity/mature topics.
   * Obviously, there aren’t any n00ds in this document. However, there are links to Google Images when talking about certain classic works. I have not had a chance to appropriately label this information, but will link it when I am able. 
   * So please be cautious if you do not wish to view this content until I am able to label it as such.
* IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS DOCUMENT
   * Please just let me know! I’d be happy to have your help and would welcome adding you, so long as the information is accurate and G/PG-rated.
   * If there’s just a link that you want to add or something, just feel free to link me and I would be happy to use your Discord username, or what what you, for the credit. 
   * Please understand I am only accepting English submissions.
* YES, you are free to suggest content to add.
   * I can’t guarantee that I’ll be able to add it, but feel free to ping me or whatever, and I’ll see what I can do, when I have time. Just please understand that due to my mental and physical limitations, that I may not be able to get it done quickly, or at all. 
* No, I am not looking for editors! 
* Please don't send me requests to become an editor. I am not giving access unless I personally know you!
   * No, I am NOT LOOKING TO TRANSLATE MY DOCUMENT! I'm not even done writing it! While it's something I might consider in the future, it wouldn't/won't be til I complete this.
* CONTENT THAT IS DEPRECIATED WILL BE KEPT, BUT SERVED WITH A WARNING!
   * This is especially true now that we have 2.0, and as such, I will go through and label it accordingly. 


LICENSING:        


PLEASE note this information when proceeding: 


* As with the rules for SD, the images created with SD are public domain.
   * If you want to see SD’s license, please visit them on Hugging Face.
* Any images used for study are copyright to their appropriate copyright holders.
* All text and images (typically hand-drawn art) created by me are copyright to me.
   * That said, please feel free to quote what I have said with credit.
   * However, I would greatly appreciate it if you did not use my actual artwork.
   * All images/art text are for personal use, and not commercial use. This is free for everyone and it’s meant to stay that way.


________________
CURRENTLY WORKING ON:


A few things to note on the outline: 
* The * on the summary is a reminder to myself to work on said section and means that I am also in the process of working on that section. 
* The ° means that there are sections that I have significant data on, but it’s going to take awhile to get through that data.
* - means that it's a long-term in-progress project.
* I straight up may not put everything here. I may, in fact, forget this exists.
* This list also may include things that are not on this document specifically but are related to this document.




* SAMPLER STUDY
   * I'm finishing up the rest of this study, mainly with just the text.
* Prompt Gen Guide
   * Working on an official guide on how to work through wordsmithing your way into your best images.
      * With the release of 2.0, I will be making differences between 1.4/1.5, etc.
* Stock Images
   * Providing some stock images for further tutorials and such that I am working on.
   * Update my morguefile account, and re-do that to update for further projects.
* Updating Git
   * This is just a continual thing I will be doing now and then, especially as I release different projects.
* Better Designer
   * Take my Better Designer Script and replace it with a compatible and basic prompt generation, which can be used for SD.
      * This I plan to release with the prompting guide. (Don't even judge my terrible JS lmao.)
* Fine tuning/training
   * I am working on putting images together for fine tuning/training/etc, for new art styles, which I plan on releasing to the community via the Stable Diffusions Concepts Library.
   * I currently have a large model I have been working on for anthropomorphic characters.
   * I have a model for antique porcelain figures, all fantasy oriented.
* Making Data Easier
   * Although this will be in Vol 2, I just wanted to mention it here. I have found methods for streamlining data generation, which I plan on releasing and making tutorials on how to use, even for those who aren't technically minded.
      * These will be both video and text tutorials.
* Vol 2, etc!

   * Just search for sunberry. 
   * Please note I don’t typically accept friend requests unless we get to be friends.
      * I'm also a hermit… a nerdy hermit lady that doesn't have much to do other than go to the doctors and write this document, apparently.
* MODELS, ETC:
   * https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library/furrpopasthetic
      * I made the furrpop aesthetic for ease of use, for those who are interested in training/using models, etc!

      * The keyword is <furpop>

      * This has been changed into a full dataset I have been working on.
   * https://huggingface.co/sd-concepts-library/seraphimmoonshadow-art

      * Screenshots/<object> training of the Three Stooges.

ABOUT ME (IF YOU CARE):


My name is Sunny. I'm a, haha, far-too-fat, disabled lady with an insatiable desire to learn and to help people. I have quite a few rare diseases that just make life the quandary it is. Long story short is…I'm really just here to have fun, create, and plug emmavacado. 
I am a game developer, 3d modeler, traditional and digital artist, writer, pianist, singer, composer, teacher, and avid reader. I'm a nerd. And probably most definitely an idiot. But having ADHD makes life fun, ig! I have plausible deniability for not remembering anything. 
My fountain of useless (or not useless??) knowledge is here to aid me in my quest for knowledge in helping others. Along with all those art history reports, all the times I was dragged through life because of my family's addiction to architecture, and maybe all the times I read the dictionary/encyclopedia, Ifigured I'd do something useful with my time. 
If there's anything you would like to add to this document, let me know. I am often not available due to my medical conditions but you can ping me….repeatedly, if you want. I mean, there's no guarantee I'll respond, but your luck is probably greater if you do.

WHAT IS THIS GIANT DOCUMENT ABOUT ANYWAY?




Hello, and welcome to my giant guide! This guide is meant for anyone who wants to learn about AI art generation, regardless of where they are in life. I want to help make it so that we can all use this wonderful technology together! (This guide has been written with Google Translate in mind.)
This guide covers a wide range of topics, starting with SD 1.4., which you may or may not be familiar with, up to 2.0. You will learn the basics of prompt generation (that's what you type to the AI so that it will generate things for you!), tips, tricks, and pitfalls, all kinds of stuff about art, how to make your own models, etc!
If you are just getting started with AI art generation, and have not read this document previously, or were not part of the beta, please see my new "Notes for Newcomers." These notes will give you insight about each section to help make it easier for you to understand the document, and are located before each section and are this fabulous shade of green.




BEGINNER QUESTIONS


* How do I Install SD?
   * While I did write a guide for this, it is outdated. Thus, I recommend that you join the Discord and check out the Channel #start-here. It should give you all the basic instructions you will need to install SD on your system.
* I read #start-here, watched YT vids, etc, and my brain still feels like a fried, mashed potato. There's too much to read, and I feel overwhelmed!
   * Good. Welcome to my world, haha! (Don't worry--there's solutions!)

WHY ARE MY PROMPTS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE BOT?


WHY are my prompts so different from the bot, HOW can I make what I used to make, and HOW do I know the difference?


Way back when, in the ages before DreamStudio, there was a bot that responded to our every command. We sorrowed when its sweet powers faded. Yet, there was hope--yes--the light of DreamStudio and open source lay before us…
But when we reached, yea, and began to slam our fingers against the keys to write yet another "trending on artstation, 4k," we realized…something…was different. 
Weeping, wailing, and gnashing our teeth in confusion, we were told things were scaled back, which was fine. Yet still, we were left confused. And thus, this section was born…


BAD SEEDS


When I first started using DSL, I was able to use my og keywords and seeds and it popped out the same stuff.
Imagine my dismay when that changed. 
While they did cut back the site when they changed to the public version, the way I was going about prompts was not going the same way. 
Here are some comparisons to give you an idea of what I am talking about:






ORIGINAL SEED:


  



Seed, When put into DSL, before public:


  



Now, you may assume these are similar enough, and they are, to a point, but if you had generated as many of these as I had, you could instantly tell the difference.
The world/characters/shapes were much flatter, the general style is inconsistent, the style of the strokes on the animals changed, etc, which is due to several factors like the steps, sampler, keywords, etc. (A lot of people have done some great comparisons on these various styles, and there are links to them in this document, but I will be discussing them here and what they even mean. It also is important to note that the Discord bot was limited to 50 steps as well, which screws over some of the samplers, and the default sampler of DSL is k_lms.)  And I want to be clear that this doesn't leave us hopeless--rather it gives us a greater opportunity to learn and understand these systems and how they interpret the world. 
Unfortunately, the only reason I got this result was because of the seed. Which, I would like to add, I was glad that was even possible. For the record, my prompt was: 


“3d Littlest Pet Shop dragon, Spring theme, nature, grapes, Greek mythology, sparkling, master painter and art style of Noel Coypel, art of Émile Eisman-Semenowsky, art of Édouard Bisson” with the seed 4128571611


If you put this exact wording in now, at the base, you will get something like these:


  



Turn the guidance to max, and you get:




  
  
  





        It’s like a highlighter threw up and then jabbed my eyeball with a sharpie! (In other words, be careful with the guidance and test it incrementally for the best results.)
        How did this become NO from GO!?
(For the record, I mostly "dreamed" in #47 and my Discord is csunberry. So you can see all of my og processes there.) 
If you look at my "Old Masters" section below, you'll see exactly how I was building these prompts. 
When I first began building my LSP prompt, at the beginning of the beta, I began with the following phrase: 


  



This allowed me to create such things as:




  





This was all without needing to generate other seeds, add a significant amount of keywords, etc. 
To be clear, yes, I have used the DSL site. Yes, I have it running on my own system. Yes, I have used the standard version, and also lstein's branch/fork. (If you don't know what that means, don't worry about it.) I've used the dreambot, using both the web interface, and just the script, and img2img. And, I have used the "demo" on that lovely, squishy FaceHugger.






And fresh, hot off the press from my computer this morning with my og prompt, I give you:


  



Please feel free to scream at the horror show. 


________________




WHAT ARE TOKENS?




Tokens? I hear you say, "This isn't an arcade."  
Tokens represent words, or parts of words, in a given sentence that the AI reads to make your prompt.
Think of tokens as the amount of money you are putting into an arcade cabinet to play your "game." The "amount," aka, the quality, determines part of the output. (Other things determine the quality and faithfulness, but we will get to that.)
First, your commas should really only be used to separate subjects…unless you just feel like wielding them like wild cards. I mean, go ahead and have a chop at that status quo. Just keep in mind that using them, or not using them, along with periods, etc, can drastically change your prompt.
Secondly, all those little words mean something, so screw grammar. You really don't have to use it as much as you might think. The thing to really keep in mind is that the more you write, the more difficult you can make it for the AI to understand what you want, so keep it simple…at first. (Unless you’re repeating for the sake of enforcement. Or if you just want to write a novel and see what happens.) The more you write, the more of your tokens are used. This is part of the reason you can straight up write something and it'll be like, "Nah, brah."
Let's do a very simple study. We are going to use Facehugger for this study here.
I am going to use:


"A teeny tiny golden little puppy eating a very sweet piece of strawberry shortcake."


Vs


"A tiny golden puppy eating a strawberry shortcake."


Also, I will/did use the default settings. (45 steps, 7.5 guidance.)












  





And our second set of images….




  





So, it's pretty obvious just how different the second set of images are. They're just as adorable, and the first clearly has some sort of size difference going on. (Repetition still matters!) The first also features strawberry shortcake while the second really only features strawberries. In the second version, it looks like there were attempts to create strawberry shortcake, but they were both vastly different, and don't show it. We also have to ask, why did the last one suddenly change style, too? 
Well, we haven't pinned down a style, and we didn't ask it to, so we can learn if we don't "pin" our prompt, it may vary wildly.
Let's take "A tiny golden puppy eating a strawberry shortcake" and dice it up:


"A tiny golden puppy, eating a strawberry shortcake."


This time, our little puppy has gone rogue! Half the time they are eating shortcake, and half the time strawberries. 




  





Okay, okay…let's think.


If we are supposed to use simple words, then our best phrase would be:


* Tiny golden puppy eating strawberry shortcake
* Tiny golden puppy, eating, strawberry shortcake 
* Tiny golden puppy eating, strawberry shortcake


The second phrase nets us…


  



Well, we have the puppy, we have eating, both subjects being separated.


With the last phrase…




  



They're cute but once again, our shortcake is out of style. So…why? 
Let's see what happens when we toss on some gobbledegook:


"Tiny golden puppy eating strawberry shortcake in Southern part of California on a Wednesday in July"




  



This time, we can see that it tried to add the words summer and California into the mix. These are the words that actually meant something.
So, what does this mean? How does this apply to DSL, running it on our own systems, and making what we actually want? And making what we actually made before? 




Also, for reference, yes, this is the same running on your own system, 50 steps.


  
  
  
  



First, let's go over what we can observe just by looking at these images in general:


* There's not a whole lot of data on puppies eating. I think this might be why we see so few images of eating in general but it could just be our keywords.
   * This means that when you create something, start with something simple and build on it. Like with the first image sets of images with all the shortcakes, it's probably the best set. 
* Repetition still works, which means/tells us that many of the good things we observed in DSL are still available…
   * You just have to really think about how you are using it. 
   * I would take any of the prompts you created and take some time to think about how they are put together. I have included a link to the tokenizer below if you want to check and observe how your own tokens might be interpreted. 
* Again, commas, periods, (or if you don't use them), where you place the words, etc, can influence your prompt.
   * So, I typically ask myself, "What is my subject doing, in the simplest terms?" 
   * Then I build AROUND that main idea after putting it first. 
* Lastly, although this is unsaid, you now need to understand sampling, steps, etc, which I will get into.


QUICK TIP:




If you are really curious about tokens, here is more information about them:




* OpenAI Article on Tokens
   * Basically explains what Tokens are, a breakdown of them, and how to more effectively understand them. 
* OpenAI Tokenizer
   * See what tokens your prompt could be using. 
* In-depth Article on How Fine Tuning Works
   * Basically, how images and text can guide SD, and is well worth a read.




But let's say you're not interested in repetition. You just want your prompt to work out of the box that you had before. (For the sake of the record, here is: “Tiny golden puppy eating strawberry shortcake, strawberry shortcake”)
As you can observe, and from what I have typically observed, repetition is often repeated in the background. But, the order still matters. Order=priority.
Due to this, if I put “strawberry shortcake, tiny golden puppy eating strawberry shortcake,” ¾ are what we want, with the first really putting pink in the foreground to show that it tried.




  





________________
FIXING MY ABOMINATIONS




I wasn't about to be undone by this whole thing. The beauty of my original prompt was simply that it just worked, almost every time. And that is why it was so surprising when (thefirenationattacked) it went and changed so drastically.




  
  



Like the puppies outlined above, including the strawberry shortcake ones, I decided to, once again, start with the process of elimination.
What is causing what? If you can’t find the cause, you’re not going to solve the problem. So, like an idiot, I reached out to the ether, and began to study every aspect of SD, continuing my work with understanding AI image generating.
My goal was to begin with the central figure--just making those little cuties actually look real and cute and FUZZY again. I learned a significant amount from this process, which I will share with you in hopes that you can learn from my own bumbling.


________________
THE PROCESS


The first thing I did was run my usual phrases through the “machine.” My typical keywords that melded the phrases together had been “realistic fur,” “mythology,” and “forest.”
The first thing I noticed was that the 3D appeared to be messing up the image. This was pretty obvious, given the appearance:




  





While these are not necessarily bad images of themselves, they absolutely leave a lot to be desired. 
But what was the most obvious, besides the fact the lighting was kind of off, and would have better results if I shoved "octane render" in there, was that the artists I had chosen were not melding with the prompt in the first place.
All of the old images almost always had insta-fab backgrounds:




  

  

  





And when the backgrounds were less prominent, they still had a very oil-based feel:


  

  

  



Furthermore, any sort of "figures," this including ones that were more human-like and less:


  

  

  



If I wanted more complex backgrounds, all I had to do was fiddle with the key words I knew the og artists were familiar with and I would be gold. (The above example has words like gumball, etc.)
While I already knew weighting (which I will explain later) was an issue, what I couldn't understand was why it no longer wanted to play nice. 
You know, what was the difference between then and now? Why had the weighting changed? Something wasn't adding them correctly, or it wasn't being applied to everyone anymore. 
(Think of weighting as the priority given to each word.) 
Since it was having a rough time with 3D, I thought I would throw in some 2D elements: 


“illustration_of_3d_Littlest_Pet_Shop_animal,_master_painter_and_art_style_of_Noel_Coypel,_art_of_Émile_Eisman-Semenowsky,_art_of_Édouard_Bisson”


  
  

  
  





The first two are decent, with cell shading and sort of a semi-painted texture overlay, but the other two, while they have their charm, also battled the ugly tree. 
Once again, the AI had the general shape, color, and the idea down, but it couldn’t seem to put the background into it. I actually tried putting in words for the landscape, but it just wasn’t having it.
And yes, naturally, I could put in 3D keywords like “unreal engine scene, octane render, shader x, y, z” to produce:


  
  





But as I am sure you’re aware, that’s not even close to what I was looking for.
So, I took out the 3D. I axed it just to see what would happen. Unfortunately, in doing so, I lost a lot of the original volume/depth of the figurines. Everything kept coming back very 2d and flat, like these:


  





Like the puppy, the style was not consistent in the least. It would just randomly change, without any particular rhyme or reason. I might as well have been using hot glue on popsicle sticks in the middle of a heat wave. 
Once again, I asked the question—what does the AI truly understand?
One thing I realized while creating the “Old Masters” section was that while the AI may not understand fundamental art principles or 3D spaces very well, the people/artists/info that has been built into the datasets can/do—and you can use this to your advantage.
Understanding this is incredibly key because when you consider the reference material, you can create a lot of hack work that you would not have otherwise thought possible. (I know a lot of people just put prompts together and there's nothing wrong with that, but if you really take the time to study what you are creating, it can really help you. )
In terms of my prompt, too, it's also part of understanding what's going wrong.
After rearranging a bunch of text, and inserting my “realistic fur” into the design, I finally managed to get the 3D model to produce fur.


master_painters_and_art_styles_of_Noel_Coypel_and_Émile_Eisman-Semenowsky_and_Édouard_Bisson_of_3d_Littlest_Pet_Shop_animal_realistic_fur


(so no commas)




  





It wasn't 100% what I was going for, but it wasn't bad.
Anyway, over and over I tried, using different kinds of mediums (that's traditional art things like colored pencils, folks, not a hocus-pocus spirit-caller), rearranging phrases, removing and adding commas---the works–to try to “get the backgrounds back.”
And though I pegged down how to get the fur fairly quickly, these issues still remained:


* No consistent style, esp with the bkgs.
   * I tried words like oil painting, colored pencil, mixed media, gauche, etc.
* The 3D constantly overrode the whole thing.
   * And while I could lean into the 3D, I didn't feel inclined.
* You were lucky if you got a background.
   * It didn’t matter where you put things like forest, landscape, etc.
* Limbs were still acting like mutated aliens.
   * Go forth, my abominations!!!


I thought, perhaps it was an artist thing---maybe they all graduated from the ghost art academy and came back to revenge haunt me. So I tried switching out their names/order, the kinds of mediums, etc…and I’m pretty sure that this is why these have such soulless eyes:






  



At this point, while I had started to see that I could create some cool backgrounds, the general style lacked substance, was possessed, and was far too sharp. Nothing was really meshing together. The more I tried to increase the quality, the worse (and sharper) it got. 
This was a common trick in upscaling in the olden days--add noise, do some sharpening, etc., so I had a bit of a chuckle when it happened for nostalgia's sake.There were also a lot of laughable moments as I decided to follow "what will happen if I press this button."




Sometimes repetition can just leave you on the bad end of the stick, like this:


  
  



Sometimes, you just have to laugh when things go wrong.

USING IMG2IMG


I’m not going to speak a whole lot on this, but I just wanted to mention that I did, in fact, try this, just to see what the result would be.
I did this because of the forest backgrounds not being consistent. And while this clued me once again that it was obviously the weights, it gave me more food for thought about how each kind of media could be represented. 
This is one of the original images:




  





Which, in turn, made me realize, yet again, something very important–img2img was great but it could not solve my problem, and that the new system clearly had the ability to mimic the old art but a finer aspect was missing. This allowed me to confirm it was possible to still have something similar to my old backgrounds, though. 
So, my next part was to determine if there was a quality issue.

TAKING STEPS




What are steps?
Steps are how many tiny little actions the AI takes to get to the final image. (Of course, there’s a lot more to it than that. There's a super great post on Twitter about how SD arrives at its images and it's written in such a way that those with very little knowledge can understand it.)
There are many things that make up the quality of an image--and every image in this tutorial here is first gen, so I have not been using any seeds, but using seeds can make your image better–and other things like steps, the sampler (think of that like a stylistic filter), and guidance/cfg/etc, and the quality of the prompt itself, all determine how good your prompt comes out. (Besides how good SD itself is, obviously.)
Samplers and their outputs are tied together. Some samplers do well with a lot of steps while others do well with just a few steps. This is why playing with samplers/diffusers is important because you really want to get the best bang for your buck, which is why I have an in-depth study on this particular topic below.
To give you an example of steps, here's an example for you using my original phrase, “3d Littlest Pet Shop, master painter and art style of Noel Coypel, art of Émile Eisman-Semenowsky, art of Édouard Bisson” only.

500 steps, PLMS Sampler


  
  
  
  
  



As you can see, there can be a wide amount of variance, even within just one sampler. I’ll be providing more examples of this below, so let’s continue.
        
________________
WHAT’S REALLY IN THERE?




When I first started generating prompts, my idea was to take the old, and roll it into something new. 
I took many of the old styles of the old masters and rolled them into modern objects, etc.
I also had the approach of trying to find specific items and act as if photographs had been taken of them, and if not, to try to see if they had been drawn. This method worked really well, because if there wasn't a photo, there was most certainly a drawing, and that was something 
So, now that I had resolved the whole "Hey, now you're fuzzy again," I moved on to analyzing the backgrounds, separate from the designs themselves.


  
  

  
  





        First, I just threw up some generic keywords with all three artists, and this is just what plopped out, which is far better than what it was pooping out before. The style was far more consistent, which made more sense, given that they were all from the same style of painting. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong, you know?
Now, I wanna be clear that I knew that when I just put in the prompt, I was aware that it was likely going to be…odd. The og artists weren't really into painting animals, per se. (I really just wanted to see the quality of the oil painting and the acrylic.)
So I figured if I put in animals, it would be debatable.

But, I had to give them a fair advantage, and decided to check out each artist individually to see what the AI would come up with…and boy was it WEIRD.

Tbh, I find these outright hysterical–THAT HAIR. That green llama…rat that's realistic? Totally my jam there ngl. That blanket looks all snuggly. The armadillo/t-rex belongs in Star Wars, and that kangaroo-tiger is going to steal my soul, sheesh.
To give everyone a reference of what these artists' works are actually like: 
Noel Coypel painted a lot of mythological paintings as well as Christian-related works. He shoved a lot of people into his paintings, which is why I think the prompt tends to cram a lot of buddies right together. It was just his thing to cramp everyone together as if they were one moving body. 
He also used a lot of bold colors and his paintings overall just had this sense of power and energy that oozes from the canvas. 
Émile Eisman-Semenowsky painted a lot of women. There’s so much contrast in his works; they are very mood, dark, and powerful. While he focused a lot on East Asia, and quite a few of his works do contain a lot of color, a great many of them are very detailed, with flowers, a sense of richness and good taste, there’s quite a bit of variance here to look at. He did have a flair for decadence, I think, or, at the very least, enjoyed painting the lifestyle of the ladies in his works. 
Édouard Bisso’s palette was just so colorful, and it’s really just what drew me to choose him for the last act of my paintings. He had a statement with folds, flowers, movement…ah! It’s just all so lovely, and his backgrounds complimented his work. 
Honestly, I don’t think the AI really does their work justice when put together.

________________
UNDERSTANDING SAMPLERS


To reiterate, in case you didn’t read it before, there’s samples in this Google Doc here with a wide variety of images, so shoutout to the other people who have done their own work in this area as well. 


Sampler, sampler, what is in a sampler? Is it like Cosco on Saturdays where you can, or could, graze on all those things for free?
No, but what sampler you use makes all the difference. Once again, I reiterate what I said before, which is that there is a high amount of variance for small margins in certain contexts. 
That can mean a lot of mystery, and it can mean a little.
When on the DSL site, you will notice this little box here:


  



It is set to k_lms by default. You can change this yourself to test and see how your prompt is affected. 
So, what is a sampler? Think of it like a filter, perhaps.
To make this a little bit easier for everyone to understand right off the bat, let's just look at some examples of tests that others have done so we can get an overall feel of what this means.        
Studies that others have done regarding the samplers:


Because of how whopping huge these images are, I’m going to simply include them as links:


* Totally stole this from Handi’s message.
   * There’s also a companion image to this, which you can see here.
* There’s also a recent study by Binx#0666, if you want to take a look at it.
* And here is a paper on K_diffusion samplers. The pdf direct link is here. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A VERY TECHNICAL PAPER, though it’s quite fascinating to read.
   * Also, this paper is actually a sort of debate-based paper, but I’m going to ignore this aspect cuzidontcare.
   * For those who really just aren’t interested in reading, here is a brief overview of it:
      * Basically, the paper goes over how diffusion models are gaining popularity, how they can be used in a wide variety of applications over other models.
      * It goes over Gaussian noise, the process of de-noising–basically what makes the images smoother, etc.
      * —-----I’ll finish this later, lol, rl


So, what can we actually learn from these images, and what do they mean, especially for non-artists? 
I’m going to start with the second image, “Sampler Comparison.”
Take a look at the front row only, and disregard the style. We are going deeper than this, because the style is relative to the subject, and there are many things that make up a style. And since I really want you to understand this, we’re going to look at things from five gazillion totallynotmental ways of looking at things.
Images are made up of three things: hue, value, and saturation.
Hue is your base color, like blue green, or mauve. Didn’t expect me to say mauve, did you? Yeah, that’s right! Keep on your toes, pal! :P Someone has to know what they’re doing, and it’s not me!
Value is how dark or light a color is. Think of it as the difference between a pastel pink versus a dark pink.
Saturated is how saturated something is--think of how a highlighter yellow is compared to a soft pad of butter. And since we’re using SD, I am totally using these images for the purpose of making it make sense to you. Although, yeah, I could use my own…as if I don’t have five thousand images of “explain art” here lying around. Anywho…
        
[Examples of hue, value, and saturation]


  
        
  

  



With me so far?
        Great!
        Now, since all of the images aren’t going to fit in here, I’m going to take the last two images and add them here just so we can compare hue/saturation vs value:


  

  





Take the time to just kind of compare how the last two images on the right are a lot more saturated. The color palette is different, too. The first four images are green, red, and yellow, while the last two start to shift. The green becomes more saturated and blue, and the red becomes more of an orange. We see a lot more black and less of the grayscale mid tones; it’s pretty much a silhouette, really. Finally, in the last one, the entire thing has shifted to a yellow hue, with purple becoming part of the palette and now it’s a complimentary color palette.We also see that the mid/semi light gray has returned to the palette, but has kept the wired look.
Now, take a second to just look at the bottom faces–just the grayscale ones. What do you notice? 


1. The contrast is really big here. Notice just how bright the face is compared to the rest of the body.
   1. We also see a lot of edge lighting. There’s a lot of really bright pieces that show where the light is just kind of falling off. 
   2. In general, we have a very wild look, with everything managing to look entangled due to its shape. It’s bent, but because of the little wires just kind of jutting out, it gives it this sort of unkempt look.
   3. The body is really just black, which allows us see the wires more freely, 
   4. Overall, notice how the light just kind of falls off. 
   5. Even if we were to take away the glasses, notice how the face has a very rounded look. The transitions are very smooth, and I think this applies to a lot of the image.
2. This one has a lot of mid tones for the face. 
   1. There’s a lot less contrast here. It still keeps the theme that we see in 1, but the face is sharper and the overall look feels more organized, and almost symmetrical.
   2. We see a few edges being lit, but this is mostly not present.
   3. This image is focused more on the finer details–small, repeatable edges.
   4. The shading here is a lot flatter, but nonetheless, the emphasis here is on the face.
   5. There’s a lot more balance overall. It’s a lot cleaner, so perhaps keep this in mind for your renders.
   6. The face is very sharp–we have some hard lines but not too much detail. There’s a little bit of light on the chin but not too much. 
3. This seems to be a blend of 1 and 2. We have a little bit of that chaotic wildness of 1, but the tightness and symmetry of 2.
   1. I don’t know how these tests were performed, which is why I have my own study below. 
   2. Some of the details in 2 have kind of merged onto the wires, and smaller wires have become incredibly bright.
   3. The hair has now also become a bunch of small little rings.
   4. Again, we also see that the whole idea here is that there’s a bunch of little wires jutting out. We can also see that the wires have been placed in the same place as one, leading me to believe that this is an iterative work, rather than being a true example of what actual iteration would be.
   5. The face is also combined from 1 and 2, making it both round and pronounced, and the forehead has now been shaped into a circle, and goggles have been placed on the eyes.
   6. There’s more contrast between the head and the neck, allowing for deeper colors.
   7. Her mouth is now open, which removes some of that stern nature in her face.
   8. Also, I’d like to note that once again, there aren’t a whole lot of light values to really work with in general, but it gets the job done.
4. Our last one seems to be the oldest of all of them.The way that the grayscale is, it’s almost like it’s a faded photo.
   1. We’ve gone back to 1 in this respect. The tubing is strong and bold again, with a lot of weight and depth. The light is still very full and detailed. 
   2. I would have to say this is probably the most cohesive. It’s like it’s taken the last three images and combined them with the hair and the sharpness. 
      1. Since I don’t know the og image, there’s no real way to tell where this began.
      2. That said, SD learns from its past images.
   3. The holes are now randomly placed–it’s very much a composite of the last three.
   4. But now you can see her somewhat broken arm, which is a nice little implicit detail.
5. Naturally, the last two are the biggest changes. 
   1. Her hair is now small and fine, having a sort of “wet” look.
   2. The grayscale has been transferred to the background to break up all that white space.
   3. The figure is now a silhouette. There’s a sort of airbrushed look behind her, almost like a paint splatter. It somewhat resembles a pod, to be honest, adding to the cybernetic feel.
   4. We see a little additional hardware, some symmetry has been brought out, the face has more skin wrinkles/detail, and the overall shift and mood has changed.The emphasis is really on the circuit board/vector-ish background.
   5. There’s much more of a vector/symmetry feel to it.
6. Continues the previous theme, once again reiterating on the last.
   1. It’s taken 4’s face, used all the symmetry, and now has the most unique use of value, it shows how this study was done–iteratively–to the best of my knowledge from observation.
   2. The use of the circles, bars, etc, is overall very unique, artsy, and I honestly think that it’s a really good representation of some incredible work.


So, what does all of this matter? 
Style is such a huge topic, and it’s something that I discuss more in-depth in other places. But there are SO many things that make up a style, from the use of color, to how big someone draws the eyes, to proportions like hands or feet. It’s more than just that, too–it’s about asking yourself fundamental questions–what does x look like? You can always tell when it’s a Pixar or a Disney movie, so what does your style/your art going to say about you and about your subject matter?
Say you have a robot, in this particular case, right? What’s a new robot look like compared to an old one?
A new robot might be shiny and clean, have chrome and sleek angles, whereas an old robot might be boxy and large, kind of like how old computers were mother effing HUGE. Using these—it allows the viewer of these images to make a comparison, and be able to form opinions and dialogues about the subject matter. Also, it doesn’t matter if the art is created by AI or by you alone–these principles still matter, and understanding these fundamental principles can help you create better prompts, imho.
Also, some samplers, from my observation, tend to be more vibrant or muted; this is why I have chosen to put this section about color here instead of other places.


  
  



Now, I know we just discussed value a lot but what about color?


[A Crash Course on Color]


Colors are a very complex subject, but I’m going to shove you into the color space and tell you exactly what goes on in here. Colors can do a lot of things like make your eyes literally rest (red/blue/yellow), show you something is dangerous, and they also LIE TO YOU about what you are actually seeing. They can make you feel emotions--happy or sad or calm, so knowing this kind of stuff can help you evoke the right kind of feeling in your works.
In this section, we're going to go over some basic knowledge about color, color types, palettes, meanings, blah blah blah. Read it and you'll find out.
Colors are made up of two types–warm and cool colors, which are not determined on whether or not they have sunglasses. Warm colors are things like reds, oranges, and yellows. Cool colors are blues, some greens, and purples. It makes more sense if you look at things known as the color wheel. Or, in my particular case, this very, very old color square I drew.


  



The color wheel is basically there to remind you of what colors go with each other, what makes a color warm or cool, etc. But there’s a lot more to it than that.
Look at how the colors gradually transition.
The normal color wheel has these colors:


  

        But when you actually blend these colors together, you get in-between colors you’re familiar with like yellow-green or bluish-purple. (If you are color-blind, I suggest looking at color palettes for the color blind. You can still use this information, of course, even if you are colorblind.) 


  



WARM AND COOL COLORS:


        First, let’s go over what colors are warm and what colors are cool.


* WARM COLORS
   * Red
   * Orange
   * Yellow
* COOL COLORS
   * Blue
   * Green
   * Purple


Warm and cool colors are exactly what they sound like--warm and cool. These colors can be used to accentuate a scene in a lot of ways. For example, you can use the warm colors to represent the sand in these two pictures, and blue/purple to represent the shadows/a cool respite from the heat.


  
  



There’s a catch, though. Cool colors can become warm colors….and warm colors can become slightly cool, to an extent. 
What do I mean by that?
There are two ways that warmth is determined. One, the color wheel, and two, what’s in your scene. If your scene is made up of blues, purples, and greens, green is considered the warmest color. If your scene is made up of green, yellow, and orange, then green is your coolest color. And no, it doesn’t really work the other way around. Red, orange, and yellow are still warm colors if they’re all slapped together until you start mixing red with blue, etc. 
In my color splash/wheel example above, you can see how I transitioned the colors. As the color goes from red to blue, you can see it becomes cooler, and the red changes to a cool color. The same applies to the green as it goes from kind of a turquoise to green and to yellow-green.
I know it’s a little confusing but understanding warm and cool colors is really important.
        Pretend your scene is broken into three pieces. Let’s say each part takes up the same amount of space. The front chunk, the foreground, should be filled with warm colors. The second part, called the middle ground, should be filled with, say, colors in between, and your background should be filled with cool colors. You can also switch this around, of course, and have warm shadows and cool lights. Regardless, this allows your viewer to understand distance, mood, helps set the contrast, etc. (We’ll discuss why and how later.)
So, just to recap, all scenes are made up of foreground, middlegrounds, and backgrounds. Just in case you didn't understand what I said, here is an example, with the black and dark gray representing the foreground, the mid gray representing the middle ground, and the light representingthe background: 
  



This is an example of using cool colors in your foreground:


  



And using warm colors in your foreground, and cool colors in your background: 


  

Although yes, the pink here is a bit of a cooler color, ngl. But it is still considered warm. :)


And here is a mix of both:


  

Original doodle, without the color correction, since my Galaxy Lite is debatable for color, so I just didn’t quite care LOL.


Another way you might think of your foreground, middle ground, and background is through the lense of camera angles, lime mid shots, closeups, etc, all of which SD uses, and has the capability to use. 
Or, you can just imagine yourself on a mountain, looking at city lights, or, if you hate heights, at some beautiful scene above in the distance. 


  

Warm colors and cool colors in the background.

AI is great and it's a wonderful opportunity for all of us to create, but it's also an opportunity for all of us to learn. I genuinely suggest that you take time to actually learn about color, composition, etc. Not only is it fun, but it doesn’t hurt to learn something new and these skills can translate across all different kinds of subjects.
This can help you visually understand what something good looks like and you can try replicating it. Do it enough times and you will build a library of knowledge in your head about it.
Combined with the right sampler, steps, and the right keywords, this will make your prompts stand out. Not only that but you'll learn something about the world, and maybe something about yourself.
Let's move on to some basic color palettes. We will start with complimentary colors.


COMPLIMENTARY COLORS:




        As you might have noticed with the sampler, the image was red and green, before it switched to mostly purple and yellow. Both sets of colors are complimentary colors. These are probably some of the most used colors and tend to pretty much pop up everywhere. If you ever forget what they are, just search for a color wheel online and look at the opposite color and that will tell you what the corresponding complimentary color is.
More than likely, you’ve already come across this, but this is where the color wheel comes in handy. Whatever is directly across on the wheel is the complementary color. 
        If we take a look at the wheel, what do we see?


* Blue=Orange
* Yellow=Purple
* Red=Green


        Note that when using complimentary colors, you have a primary color, like red, and an accent color, like green, so 75% of your drawing would have red, while %25 would have green. You don’t want these colors (usually) to be equal.  You want one color to be more present over the other.


  



This may work for certain instances, but when it comes to painting, or any design, balance (not speed) is key. 


  



See how much better the balance is? It stands out a lot more. Essentially, that is what color theory is: understandinding what draws the eye in and why. Complimentary colors is one of the many ways to do that. (There’s a lot more color combinations, but we’ll also get to that later.)
But first, a pitfall...


COLOR, THE DECEIVER:




Color, like cake, is a lie. A sweet, delicious lie for my waistline.
Colors are deceptive. Just because you see a color and think it’s a particular color doesn’t mean it’s actually that color. 
Colors affect each other, and by that, I mean that your brain can trick you into thinking particular colors are there when they aren’t. (Just think of that dress, people!) 
So, hocus pocus, and bedazzle, here’s an effing example: 


  



When you put the colors next to each other: 


  



These two examples are subtle, but they don’t have to be. Let’s look at a more extreme example that I actually made in college v2 in 2009 hahahah lol: 
  

The reason this happens is because of two things: one, the way your eyes work and pick up light--think of it like the colors spread over next to each other--and two, the DREADED VISUAL VIBRATION!!!! AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
Visual vibration is when your eyes freak out because something is too saturated and it’s just difficult to look at. Here’s an example of it: 


  

OW! I need a priest just looking at it!


Oh, 80’s, you were a perfect time to explore that along with huffing all those markers and learning that bright colors made my eyes bleed.
There’s also a lot more to color than just the hue, saturation, etc, to consider. Because color is more than just about what we see, but the psychological perception associated with those colors. 


THE COLORS, MASON! 
What DO they mean?:




Let's start with the following colors: black, white, gray, blue, green, yellow, red, orange, brown, pink, and purple.
Most people think of and their associated meanings. Obviously, this varies from country to country but we will be applying things via US standards.


* Red
   * Typically means warning! Stop signs, red flashing lights–it gets your attention. 
   * Also represents heat.
   * Can also represent passion, etc. It’s just one of those colors that always wants to take your attention, so always keep this in mind. It’s perfect for using sparingly, especially in night scenes.
* Yellow
   * Means warning or caution, often used on road signs, especially since it just lights up so well.
   * Also associated with sunshine, warmth, etc.
   * In terms of design, interior decorating, etc, you might see it used as a pastel, etc. Or as a bright color used as an accent.
* Orange
   * May represent a hazard, such as construction work, since it’s again, a warm color, and pops out from the landscape. Bright colors tend to get your attention, as I am sure most people are automatically aware of.
   * Like the warmer colors, it’s also fairly lively, and is associated with heat/warmth, sunshine, and some might even go as far as to say creativity or enjoyment. Quite frankly, all I think of is……construction zone. AHAHAHAHA.
* Green
   * Associated with wealth, money, nature. You know, the color you see everywhere.
   * Naturally, in terms of practical use, you see it in symbols for money, etc.
* Blue
   * The sky, as if we could forget. :P Also my fave color!
   * Blue is also a soothing color that typically makes people feel calm.
   * Also represents water, things associated with the ocean, things that are cold, etc. It really just depends on the shade.
* Purple
   * Purple is often associated with royalty, (along with blue), especially because it was often so difficult to reproduce.
      * If you’re ever interested in the process of pigments, there’s a great deal of wonderful lessons you can learn about it. Everything from plants, rocks, to animal parts have been used to create pigments.
      * Purple pigment is actually really fascinating to learn about, because it actually was created from first rocks, and then eventually with Han Purple, which was used with mollusks from  ZE SEA!
      * Synthetic pigments are actually even difficult to create, even now. You can learn about Egyptian Blue here, and Blue pigments here. Blue is the most difficult of the pigments to create.
         * Natural pigments are rocks/plants, etc, while synthetic are from chemical reactions.
   * You might also see it associated with things like magic, wisdom, grandiosity, etc.
* Pink
   * Obviously, in line with red, this color is associated with love, femininity, etc.
   * Some people might also associate it now with things like breast cancer, roses, delicacy, cherry blossoms, etc. This color works so well as a pastel as well as a deeper color.
* Black
   * The color often depicted as death, also used with labels for stark contrast, and the ever-wonderful part of night mode…unless it’s too much contrast for your eyeballs. XD
   * It’s also used for sophistication, elegance, no-nonsense, etc. There’s a lot of ways to use black, like negative and positive space. 
* White
   * Purity, deity, peace, tranquility, light….
   * I’m pretty sure most people already know what this color is for, how it reflects light, and can give you a tan/sunburn even in winter.
   * For animals, too, it can be a sense of security, for camouflage, even–always think of things practically, too! It’s not just about what the color might “represent,” or what others say–but where you might see this color, even if it’s just, “I see that color as swans on the lake,” or “snowflakes on my window pane.”
* Gray
   * Associated with things that might not be “black and white,” this color might represent morals that are questionable, stormy days, depression, as well as a stalwart, neutral personality/balance.
   * Gray, like many other colors like tan, is a neutral tone, meant to balance out brighter colors in a lot of scenes. 
* Brown
   * The color of the earth, and has a rustic feel to it. We depend on the earth for so many things. From the garden to plants that make it possible for us to breathe. 
   * The vast deserts that encompass the earth to the rainforests–there’s so much to appreciate in this color–it’s all around us. 
   * It’s a color that represents us–humanity—our resilience, our hard work, and this beautiful planet that we live on.


        
By all means, it can be observed that multiple colors together mean different things. Black and white can be yin and yang, or a combination of colors may mean a specific symbol at work, etc. There’s also other specific colors that we could talk about, so keep that in mind.
Again, I’d like to just reiterate that certain colors mean different things according to your country/culture, and I’m only really speaking in regards to my own experience. Yours may be completely different, so please feel free to substitute your own experience(s), as that was just a general overview!
NOT JUST COLORS, BUT MOODS




        Colors can also represent moods as opposed to ideas as well. I know a lot of people might just think, “Ah, yah, that’s just a bunch of bunk,” but in reality, there is truth to this. Mood rings were a thing for a reason, even if they turned green! (Or why that red circle is SO annoying.)
How much influence this might have may vary from person to person. That said, color absolutely does create mood, and knowing what kinds of moods that color can invoke can really just make your pieces, regardless of how they are created, even more personal, thought-provoking, and creative. That's why it's important to understand how your color is going to be perceived by the general populace, and how people will respond to it.
Scientifically speaking, your body does, 110%, respond to color. (Stop signs are red for a reason, regardless of studies.) Here are some studies regarding this:


* The Effects of Color
   * Mentions various studies, the importance of color in interior design, and how it can be used to improve peooles' lives.
   * Discusses the psychological effects of color, and how it can change our bodies through our eyes, etc.
* Color and Psychology
   * This study covers things like our physical reactions to color, emotional responses, color theory in the past, including in animals.
   * It has links to a wide variety of studies, how they have been conducted, their backgrounds, etc.
   * Goes over the difficulties associated with studies in color, how difficult it is to maintain sustainability in research, and how golden standards need to be applied to studies going forward, as well as the need for more studies. 
   * Long-term, the writer of this paper suggests continual research into the study of color.


        Because these two studies link to the other studies, I’ll let you follow your own rabbit hole.
If you took some time to actually read and research those studies, you should have a better understanding of how we respond to color—it can be anything from sweating to our pupils dilating, etc.
So, let’s explore this concept a little bit.
If we want to make a scene that really unsettles you. Before I show you it, let me explain it. (We will be using SD for this, but I have an idea in my head.)
        First, I’m going to use a green and red complementary palette, but I will be using dark colors, including blacks and blues for the background. 
        The red is for the fire. The fire represents a warm hearth, which is typically something one might consider comfortable and sets the viewer at ease. (Unless they associate fire with something unpleasant, but I digress.)
        The blues and greens also show that it’s night time, and these are natural night colors.
        Nights and fires can be pleasant…but they can also be chaotic, and they can be ominous. If you come across a cabin on a lonely night, see a fire outside and no one around, but feel eyes on you? Yeah, that could be super spooky, man!
        Now, of course, these colors together, can create a pleasant scene, like on the left, which has more of a whimsical feeling. The second is a little more ominous due to the more chaotic, yet still whimsical feel to the shapes, but that hint of green just says, “Something isn’t quite right!!!” Which is just enough to leave the viewer unsettled. Lastly, even though there aren’t any blue shadows on the right, RIP, we have this bright fire that’s just really going. There’s nobody in sight, but the pots are turned, which means we have these oddly shaped shadows that can be cast. The immense intensity of the red just makes it feel like the fires of hell are about ready to come up and yank you right through the floor. We also have a lot of dark shadows, and muted colors, and this sort of yellow-gray, and because of this muted yellow, which is often associated with sickness/putrescence, it adds to the overall “yick!” factor. The scratches on the floor also make it look like somebody tried to get away but…didn’t. And that’s why you should gtfo that kitchen, folks!


  
  
  



        I hope that provides enough of a comparison to you to show you that getting to know why colors (warm/cool/palettes/moods, etc) are so important. I can actually use this same idea again and get an entirely different feeling by just adding a few factors!


"hearth with glowing embers in an empty medieval room with an open door and a hole in the wall, deep blue and green shadows, disturbing, creepy, complimentary colors, contrast, realistic, concept art, fantasy, detailed, door wide open, moon shining through hole in wall"


  
  
  

  
  



This time, I told it to make sure all the colors were complimentary, which, well, eh, it tried, haha.         


1. I can’t decide if it’s lava or hay. But the stump in front of the ice and a golden door…I’m not sure what we’re chopping, if we should be chopping, or if we did, but the composition is well done.
2. That’s a prison cell. That color scheme belongs in the 90’s, and I like it. It really does look like game concept art, it looks like it’s also in a high tower because that hole could fit a person through, and it also carries some sort of decadence, like it’s a converted tower, and you’re the lucky guest.
   1. Hope you like rats. (TLDR, I do.)
   2. Overall, this is a stellar use of the prompt. Well done, SD!
3. AH! What is this, Attack on Titan, or…you know what? That door doesn’t even fit, come to think of it. And what are all those black squiggles!? AH!!!! THEY’RE ALL OVER ME!!!!!
   1. That door is no protection against that eye.
   2. SD is blursed. It also got blue in there.
4. This one kind of reminds me of a stable. This picture could easily be upscaled and used with inpainting/outpainting and be made into something that really has a lot of flare. The lighting is good and it hits the mark pretty well. We’ve got a lot of contrast and two+ light sources.
5. This one, along with 2 and 3, I think, showcases mood the best. You can see that it’s chilly outside. There’s logs/warmth/fire inside. It’s got ALL of the complimentary colors, which is what makes me say it’s the best. 
   1. I think this is probably one of the best scenes that could be used to be extended. It has a lot of potential.


All of these examples should have given you a good fundamental understanding of color. So, a quick recap for you:


* There’s a color wheel–use it!
* Colors are made up of hue, value, and saturation.
* There are cool and warm colors.
* There are color palettes like complimentary colors!
* Scenes are made up of foregrounds, middlegrounds, and backgrounds.
* You can have warm foregrounds and cool backgrounds, and vice versa.
* Colors can stimulate the senses, invoke emotional responses in us, etc. 
* How we perceive color is not always what it seems—colors can trick us into thinking we’re seeing something when we actually aren’t, so be wary of this!


HOW WE ACTUALLY SEE COLOR




        How we, scientifically, see color, is kind of a trip, if I’m honest. 
        The world, for me, has always been a bit of a weird place. I was born with microphthalmia, strabismus, amblyopia, and a deviated septum, with the right side of my face getting the worst of it. (I look normal…ish. LOL.) I’ve been almost legally blind in my right eye for many years, and I’ve been left-eye dependent since I was born. I’ve had two eye surgeries, with the last being almost not-successful.  
        (Microphthalmia is a birth defect with your eyes not being fully developed/too small, strabismus is when your eyes are misaligned and they don’t work together, and amblyopia is when your eye just wanders around and has its own party whenever it wants and you don’t even notice sometimes. That means I can be staring at you and my right eye will be looking in another direction entirely.)
        The first was to correct the cross-eyed problem. Did it? Ah, sorta. 
        The second, well, it almost didn’t happen. There’s so much scar tissue in my face that the surgeon had an incredibly difficult time finishing the surgery. As such, I can’t have any more surgeries.
        I wear Coke-bottle glasses with prism in them to help with the strabismus, and my optometrist is avoiding giving me bifocals, for now, lol. (Gall, Ariel is right to call me grandma. I already have dentures anyway. Have some cookies!!)
        This left eye dependence has actually been a little bit of a boon, as it’s helped me understand perspective easier than people with two working eyes. That said, I miss a lot of depth just because I can see jack crap. I’m incredibly sensitive to color, meaning that I may need to change the colors on a device to the point no one else can actually read it except me.
Which is funny, because you would imagine that such colors would cause a significant amount of eye strain, but their relative value made it possible for me to look at them.
So when it comes to color, I always try to be careful, because when it comes to me, or other people, I try to make it so that it can be eye-catching without making my eyes want to scream and roll out of my head. I’m very sensitive to contrast, which is why learning about how we actually perceive color actually made things much easier for me to understand.
The simplest way to explain it is that light comes into our eyes. Inside of our eyes are rods and cones that are then zapped into our brain for processing. No, not construction cones, haha, but cells that “catch” the light, if you will. They’re located at the back of your eye where the retina is. Color blindness is actually a dysfunction of the photopigments of the cones–the things that control the color that you see. (Rods allow us to have night vision, and only see one color and aren’t really related to color.)
Your eye acts as a lens, and it’s got a very odd shape, not round as it’s often dawn, especially in anime. It’s actually got a little bump in the middle. Think of it kind of like a magnifying glass, or “ENHANCE!” because that’s basically its function. 
Anyway, when light zooms down on an object, certain wavelengths are absorbed, OMNOMNOM! and others are reflected. When light is reflected, we see color, which is such a funny concept. Red apple? It’s reflecting red light. Green apple? Reflecting green wavelengths.
When all wavelengths are deflected, something is white, and when all are absorbed, something is black. You probably knew this already, but hey, here we are.
        There are more scientific explanations of how our eyes work, and while I once wrote on the subject, I have decided that I’m too tired to find where I put….wherever…that writing was.
        If I ever find it, I’ll shove it in here.
        My point is that color is relative. It really, really is.
        Something that’s red in full sunlight will not look the same in the dark, and I’m sure you know this because, well, lol, you’re alive.
        Anyway, this leads to my next quick little topic, which is……


COLOR PALETTES




        I know I mentioned complimentary colors, but I wanted to briefly mention that there are other types of colors, too.
        There are:


* Monochrome color palettes
   * All the same hue.
* Analogous 
   * These are the next three colors by each other on the color wheel.
* Split Complementary 
   * Split complementary is a little weird. It’s basically, you’re taking the color to the left and the right of the would-be color and using those colors instead. 
   * So, for example, instead of using yellow and purple, you’re using yellow and a pinkish-red and blue-purple. 
   * You can see them here.
* Triadic 
   * Always a bit of a weird one to me, you’re taking a triangle and basically going, HEY, YOU’RE EVENLY SPACED FROM EACH OTHER, WE’RE USING YOU!! With three colors.
   * Color, I choose…YOU!!!
* Square
   * Same concept as above, but you’re using a square this time.
* Rectangular/Tetradic 
   * It’s basically two complementary pairs.
   * I actually recommend using Adobe, as much as I loathe CC, etc, for these kinds of color schemes because it’s just better than trying to manually do it these days.


A QUICK NOTE ON COLOR PALETTES:


* Adobe Color
   * Adobe Color is free, and it’s a great place to get color palettes from. You can drag colors around to create palettes, create gradients, and extract palettes from pictures as well.
* Pinterest Color Palettes
   * Another great place for color palettes is just to straight up search for them on places like pinterest, Deviantart, etc. There’s no shortage of palettes out there.
* Apps
   * There’s also apps for phones where you can take pictures and create color palettes from images, etc, too, just for the record. But I prefer Adobe Color.


        
Basically, there’s a lot more to color than just picking a couple of things that look shiny, rainbow-y, pastel, or otherwise. Colors and learning about them, and how we perceive them is really important.
One final thing I want to talk about here beyond color is just a little about human nature. It’s a little technical, as it was originally written for artists, but I think you can handle it! You’ve come so far, after all!


THE GESTALT THEORY:




The who now?
The “official” basic statement is that the theory is “the sum of the whole is better than its parts.” But really, the entire theory can be summed up as, “When you look at something, you try to make sense of it. Here’s some of the best ways you can do that, and here’s how a lot of people tend to make sense of things.”
The theory is actually from the 1800’s and is an entire school of psychology. If you want to learn more about it, you can actually read info on it in wikipedia here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology
Or, you can read my quick and dirty explanations. (Though it is actually worth reading into and it’s actually pretty fascinating.) The topic is actually much larger than the wikipedia entry and it’ll hurt your brain if you stare at it for too long, or you’ll spend hours in the wells of endless text.
So, let’s get some of the basic ideas across like we’ve been eating crayons.
When you look at a piece of art, your eye is typically drawn to something. At least, it should be. This is known as the focal point. This can literally be anything. People are always looking for something, so whatever you want to say better be your focal point.
That said, your brain looks at a lot more than the focal point.
There are seven “principles” of design according to this theory. (I’m not going to call them what they’re actually called because I’m just not going to.) Think of them as “seven ways we break down visual information.” (For the sake of this document, though, I’m only mentioning these two.)


* What’s Together, Goes Together
   * The closer something is together, the more associated it will be. The farther apart something is, the less it’ll be remembered. 
      * Yes, this can be used to manipulate a story and add some really interesting designs for those who are looking.
   * Spacing is the main key point here. It’s all about commonality.
      * If you want a clean design, keep things together that go together. For example, if you have a website, have your links at the top, your advertisements on the left and right, and your news in the center, etc. 
* We Look For Patterns
   * It’s human nature to look for patterns, for some more than others. The entire theory basically states we look for a framework within the chaos. 
      * This is why things like “implied line” work. Implied line means that you basically see things without actually having a line.
      * An example of implied line is this (not my art): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/902508383540760627/907403059439763497/implied_line_hand_by_akicomics_ddfq7bz-fullview.jpg
      * Notice you can see the hand even though there aren’t any lines showing the hand itself. If you want to see more patterns of implied line, you search for images online.
   * Knowing that people look for patterns...like making a rock formation that casts a shadow that looks like a human will freak people out...and be a good setup for a jump scare because, “Oh, I’m stupid, it’s just a rock.”
      * Texture is a great way to do this, too.
   * We always try to fill in missing information. This is why implication is such a huge part of horror and suspense storytelling. Allowing the player(s) to form their own conclusions will keep people coming back. (Hence why no one confirms theories, as this can stop never-ending discussion and interest!)




When you look past this focal point, you are looking at the piece as a whole, and trying to understand it as a whole. We’ll get more into that in a bit.
In terms of design, things that go together stay together. 
So, when creating a design, no matter what it is:


* Have a subject—something for the viewer to look at.
* Add a little mystery—always something to come back to and ponder. You want to give the viewer something to think about.
   * Make it memorable through color, subject, design, etc. 
* Curiosity is part of human nature along with our emotions.




BACK TO THE PROGRAM:




Now that we detoured with our lesson in color, etc, let’s get back to the samplers so that we can more fully understand SD and prompt engineering in general.


________________
SAMPLER INFLUENCE
                
Now, since we’re doing this whole LSP thing, it’s only right that I actually show you what each sample looks like with each sampler. And, to be clear, results may vary according to the steps, blahblah, if you don’t get it by now, you…didn’t read anything that I said before, probably.




  

K_lms


  

K_heun


  

K_uler


	  

K_ueler_a


  

K_dmp_2
  

K_plms
	







  

Ddim






        I wanted to include these, even though they aren’t that great, and knowing that each sampler has its own variance and amount of steps that influence each variance. For the sake of knowledge, I’m going to go ahead and just write down some cheat sheet values for you in general that I have personally found to work well so far.
        Again, as always, if you have any insight, thoughts, or critiques, you’re welcome to let me know and I can add further information to this document just so that we can help everyone.
        These are my actual recommendations for the steps/samplers for this particular prompt:




* K_euler_a
   * A 15, 20, and 30 steps, with 30 being the sweet point, I think, for this particular project. K_euler is also really good for this as well.
   * This sampler seems to be really good for fantasy projects.
* K_huen 
   * Honestly, starting at 50 steps is good here, imho, and I think that it’s something you can experiment with. I honestly didn’t go over 75, I don’t think.
* K_plms
   * As shown in the previous example, 75-200 worked well, but as mentioned in some of the studies, going up to 2000 may be the thing. I can’t say this from direct knowledge, simply because I haven’t tried it. So, if anyone wants to try and verify, by all means, please feel free to let me know if you do.
* K_dpm_2
   * I personally liked some of these at 50+


        For the rest of the prompts, I would check out the rest of the guide where I provide my conclusions.

SO, WHERE’S THE GLUE?


Now, I know some of you might be saying, well, why go through all of this effort when maybe you could use the dreambot? Well, using lstein’s branch isn’t a cure-all, and furthermore, it doesn’t, in of itself, work 100%, either. That, and not everyone has access to using it, and not everyone has a system to run SD at this particular second. (Though, let’s be fair—it’s not that hard to use Hugging Face or Google Collab.)

Well, the truth is while we might get some better results with different forks,not everyone has access to this. So I wanted to make sure that what I created was accessible to everyone. 
Secondly, it’s not fool-proof.
That said, if you have the opportunity to run SD on your own system, I recommend testing/trying out different forks because it can help you make your prompts better.
There's so much that goes into creating prompts that there really is no one cure-all, but if you are more comfortable using a webui, or if you're more comfortable just typing things in, etc, there's nothing wrong with it.
________________
UNDERSTANDING WEIGHTS


As previously mentioned, weights are probably the most important thing you can do to make your prompt work beyond steps and the type of sampler you are using. 
So, what are weights? Weights = emphasis, lack of emphasis, or a blending of emphasis. Think of them as a percentage of things that you want. Like, how much sour cream do you want on your burrito supreme? A dollop, or the entire pint? You have to specify it. That’s really why there’s so much !??? about why the way the prompts changed. And you can do this using a wide variety of symbols like () and !. (I want to be clear that using parentheses is best with the website, FH, or one of the many forks out there.)
We’ll begin without using any parenthesis/other means of weighting any kind of normalizing in order to just see what it spits out. Our phrase is:
drawing of a journal, fall feeling, hot chocolate, autumn, lock, realistic, watercolor


  
  

  
  





drawing of a journal, fall feeling, hot chocolate, autumn, ((lock, realistic, watercolor))




  
  

  
  



        While it did not add the lock, you can see that it added more of a traditional watercolor feeling. The colors and textures changed, along with the texture and size, etc–you can see the little subtleties that it removed. Let’s try this again using:


((((drawing of a journal)))), fall feeling, hot chocolate, autumn, !!lock!!, ((realistic,)) ((watercolor))






  
  
  

  
  





Each time we make an adjustment, something changes, and you can see that evidence yourself. 
Sometimes this can be a difficult process learning to understand what is going to change and what isn’t. But understanding the basics can help you at least determine what direction you should be headed in the first place.
There are positive weights and negative weights, meaning that you can nix things in your scene that you don't want. 
How you go about this really depends on the branch you are using. There are so many different ways to go about this because of it. However, according to my testing, as of 9/3/2022, I know that Facehugger (and I can assume the DSL–I haven’t tried in awhile) both accept !!! and () for weighting.




Weights can be….




* Specified with !!! and ()
   * These specify importance.
* They can also be specified with :0.50, etc.
   * Some might also just be specified with :25, etc.
   * And example would be flowers:0.50, basket:0.50
* You can normalize your weights without counting.7 7.5 8 Basically, you can make your base set statements all normalized, so if you write a bunch of unorganized ((((word)))) and ((word)), it will add it up automatically to add to 1 for you.
* Again, this really all depends on WHAT you’re using, so I really recommend checking out what fork/service you’re using for documentation.




        Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, we can do a little bit of a deep dive into the subject. 
        Like the tokenizer, understanding weights is just as vital. There’s a sort of uncanny understanding, an internal part of you that can put things together once you begin to realize the kind of things that the AI can do, which will grow over time as you become more familiar with it.
In general, if you want to learn more, practice. Look at other people. See what they are doing--maybe even take the time to recreate others' prompts. Gather as much information as possible. Your powers of observation and your desire for knowledge are the best tools you have for learning. 
And if you don't get what you want---try and try again. 
So, let’s try again.
This time, let’s use !!! instead of (). I’m going to use a very poetic phrase to prove a point.
Again, I’m just using 7.5 guidance and k_lms for this, just because I’m trying to be as consistent as possible.




Wandering within the silence of the dream, ethereal music of the universe, peace and tranquility, harmony and symmetry, art of the soul 


  







!!!Wandering within the silence of the dream,!!! ethereal music of the universe, peace and tranquility, harmony and symmetry, art of the soul 


  



        The effect here seems to be that the images are becoming more circular. Three of them feature a silhouette wandering in a foggy sort of adventure, which is exactly what we are looking for here by adding !!!! to the first portion of the sentence. 
        Now, instead, let’s try to take something away.
        Let’s say that we want MORE WANDERING and symmetry first, though, just so we have a comparison.


!!!!Wandering within the silence of the dream,!!!! ethereal music of the universe, peace and tranquility, harmony and !!!!symmetry,!!! art of the soul 




  

        Oh, I do so love that one on the bottom left. And the top left, if I’m honest. Truthfully, I like ‘em all. Kinda cool.
Now, Dear Stability, we would like less symmetry, please.
Again, please do keep in mind that negative weights work according to whatever you’re using. In this particular case, I am using the command “thing:-1” with -1 being the value, and then using normalize weights to make sure that it adds to 1.




!!!Wandering within the silence of the dream,!!! ethereal music of the universe, peace and tranquility, harmony, art of the soul, symmetry:-2


  



!!!Wandering within the silence of the dream,!!! ethereal music of the universe, peace and tranquility, harmony, art of the soul, symmetry:-3


  



        As you can see here, the symmetry has passed right through. Well, why is that? As you can see, I have !!! exclamation points, and my negative value is -3, so it really just cancels itself out.


!!!Wandering within the silence of the dream,!!! ethereal music of the universe, peace and tranquility, harmony, art of the soul, symmetry:-5


  





Now, be careful, because…don’t even try to mix ! and () all willy-nilly, dear reader, because you might as well just sign yourself over to doing the same thing, because it’s just going to treat them like they’re the same kind of thing. From my experience, it tends to treat them more powerfully, almost:




  



Which is kind of great if you're willing to experiment. But it’s super confusing if you’re not familiar with it.
As I previously mentioned, there are many different forks for SD, and there are many pros and cons to each.
To be clear, how weighting works in the console is different from this branch, etc. (The concept is the same--the method is just different.)
When using a webui like this, it makes it easier for people who might have trouble typing, remembering, or just really want to take some of the work out of it.
This particular branch is from this tutorial here. (I am running four different versions at the moment lol.)




  





Using this UI allows you to easily put in weights, just like with the og bot,if you were in the beta, or on FH, or the site.
Plus, you can preview things and you have a lot of options, which is really nice.
To show you how the UI works, here is an example:


  



I also want to point this out: while it's totally fine to be generic, like using "cool" and "warm" colors, being more specific can make your life easier. If you want your prompt to be more random, that's less of an issue.


  



Anyway, you can accomplish weighting using the methods mentioned above and below. I just wanted to show that, along with where the normalize weight checkbox is down below.


  



  



Because of the multiple ways of weighting now, I’m going to leave the rest of the weighting guides to their respective forks!

GUIDANCE


Guidance. What is it?
Guidance is how closely SD will follow your prompt. It’s also called CFG, and other weird words. Basically, how much can the AI just throw stuff in the background and make things up? How much would you like it to try to follow what you said, even if what you said was completely ridiculous? Because this number is going to determine that.
Personally, as the numbers go up or down, this is a hit or a miss. It’s really like a coin toss, because the higher you go, the crazier it can get. (I have heard the reason for this is because of PyTorch, but I don’t have any personal way to verify this, so it’s up for debate.) So I suggest when you use cfg/guidance/whatever you wish to call it, that you do so incrementally, in a way that allows you to marginally find out what works best for your particular prompt.
My best margins tend to be at 7.5, 12, and 15, but anything 20+ usually winds up in the chaos blender.
I’m going to be a bit loose with this prompt, just to make sure that 
Ah, Gandalf, have you come to visit this fool of a Took again? 


Gandalf the Gray from Peter Jackson's LotR eating a fancy birthday cake with Bilbo in his hobbit home, confetti everywhere, balloons, interior, glitter, hobbit home, laughter, friendship, fun, cinematic scene, videography, cinema still, 7.5 guidance 45 steps


  
  

  
  



I just love the fact he has become a figure. I’m not entirely sure why he has become one, or why Bilbo isn’t in any of these shots, but it really doesn’t matter because Gandalf is one with the cake in every shot, and that’s what matters.
It pretty much captured everything that I asked for it to do here, so there really isn’t much of a complaint, considering that I really didn’t do anything to actually try to make it easy for the AI to understand what I wanted besides placing the subject first as my priority.


Time to bump it up to 20 guidance, ya’ll!


  
  

  
  





My, my Gandalf, this is a fairly different party right off the bat, isn’t it? Woo! I really don’t think the way you’re looking at that cake is…um….yeah. I think you’ve been taking too much of that ole hobbit leaf, pal! Bahahaha!
The top left looks like he’s mixing a tape/turning into a DJ, the bottom left he looks drunk so he’s putting your party hat on that tower of Pisa cake, and this is the only one with Bilbo in it. The only one. And the bottom right, well, it seems like he’s had enough of party tricks and that’s why your candle is paper.
This is the cost of setting the guidance up—the saturation, sharpness, extreme contrast, blurred backgrounds, and otherwise a monumental meltdown.


Guidance at 3




  
  

  
  





I feel like in the top left, he’s become a guidance counselor to a sock puppet llama. That’s my opinion, and I’m not changing it. The one on the right is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’s somewhat rejected pastel palette, that was somehow transported dimensionally into the Shire via when Gandalf forgot his coffee, and I also like it. He's ALSO become one. One of us! One of us! And has now graduated to having multiple hands. 
I’m leaving that sentence right there.
When you put the guidance at a lower factor, your prompts can actually become a lot more creative, which may or may not be a bad thing. I think this really just depends on how good your base prompt actually is, along with a lot of the other factors that make your prompt a good base prompt along with what’s in the database, if you do any fine tuning, etc. 




Guidance set to 50


  
  

  
  



Lastly, I set the guidance to 50, and now it turned into Wind Waker. As you can see…this is just a no-go. The top left looks like it belongs in Kickle Cubicle, the top right looks like he’s had enough of that bakery, and I’m not sure if the bottom left has indicated if Gandalf has turned into a 90’s troll spy who is over your attempts to use your 
So, unless you’re prepared to be blasted out of the universe, as I have heard repeated several times, for now…keep the guidance down.






________________
UNDERSTANDING YOUR PROMPT




        In case you haven’t guessed, understanding your prompt matters. :P That’s not to say you can’t create a cool prompt if you don’t understand what you’re writing. You can throw a bunch of word salad mumbo jumbo up there and shazam! It can come up with something amazing for sure.
        I have a bigger section later in this document regarding wordsmithing, so if you’re interested in a more detailed explanation, you can check out this section below. In the meantime, let’s recap, once again, some of the information we’ve learned:




* When creating prompts, put your words into the tokenizer.
   * This helps you know what words are being used/how they might be interpreted.
   * This helps you understand how many tokens are being used
* Get to know your:
   * How grouping your words together changes your prompt
   * General priority of your words (put the ones that matter first!)
   * Learn to start with small sentences and build on them
* If you created prompts before that don’t work now, you will need to use:
   * Seeds
      * Use good ones to get better results, or use random ones for some sweet opportunities.
   * Weights
      * Learn to use them for whatever branch/site/whatever it is that you’re using to make your content.
   * Additional words
      * Understand the kind of language you can add, like mid shot or soft transitions that will change how your prompt turns out.
   * Samplers
      * Change the sampler to see how your prompt turns out! 
      * Mix, match, play with it!
   * Steps
      * Remember that samplers are 110% affected by the steps. 
   * Guidance
      * Guidance will change your results, so go up, down, and around the town just to see what happens if you want to. 
* You can also use img2img.
   * This just makes it easier. You can use some of the old images you used.
* Colors, understanding art, etc will help you become a better wordsmith/prompt engineer.
   * Remember cool/warm colors.
   * Pictures have a foreground/middleground/background.
      * So saying that something big or small in the foreground or background can really amp up your image!
      * It might be a good thing to learn about perspective. :)
   * There are color schemes:
      * Complimentary
      * Split complementary
      * Monochromatic
      * Analogous 
      * Triadic
      * Square
      * Triangle/tetradic 
* If you are basing things on an artist:
   * Research their artwork.
   * Use things that the artist(s) is/are really good at.




So, really, just the last thing that I want to really cover without getting too much into detail, since I think we’ve pretty much covered as much information as possible is to:




* Put your subject first.
* Then put in your environment.
* Then put in your keywords/anything you want to describe, such as soft transitions, or whatever it is that you’re going to do.
* And then put in your art style.
   * I often put palette colors last, too. This isn’t necessary, but you can if you want.




        Of course, you don’t have to do this. I just have personally found this to be the most effective way of doing it. You can tell me otherwise and I’ll just go, “Meh! Maybe! Prolly! Who cares?” and we can move on with life. It just seems that the left to right mojo is strong, so I suggest that you put your key things first.
        For example, let’s say that I want a chicken riding a crocodile into the sunset, holding a flaming pitchfork, wearing glitter uggs, perhaps, even. Mayhap he is in a swamp, or a field, and maybe it’s cartoonish, or in watercolor. I don’t know. Maybe I don’t care. 
        “Chicken riding a crocodile into the sunset, holding a flaming pitchfork, wearing glitter uggs, in a swamp, art style cartoon, mixed media, watercolor, digital art.” Could be my phrase.
        But it wouldn’t be the most effective one. Why? Because the information really isn’t sorted properly.
        INSTEAD, I would like to propose the phrase, “Chicken wearing glitter uggs riding on a crocodile, holding a flaming pitchfork, screaming, on a road, in a swamp, mixed media, watercolor, acrylic, oil painting, digital art.”
        Yes, I added more words.


1st


  
  



2nd


  
  

  
  



        Frankly, I think these are all bold fashion statements. Thoughts? Because I honestly think that all of these that came out are questionably fantastic! (And some look like they belong on Killing Floor 2’s cutting room floor.) 
        Look, if you’re still here after all these images, that’s on you. I take no responsibility for the nightmares I create!
        Regardless, I think it’s obvious that there’s more direction in the second set, which is my point. Again, if you want to learn more, I suggest checking out the section below, as it has a lot more info in it.
        So here’s Markiplier with a lightsaber. 
        The things I do with my time.


  
  
  



MOVING ON!
________________
THE FINAL STEPS


So, let’s put together everything we’ve learned here. I’ll use:
3d Littlest Pet Shop, realistic fur, oil painting, landscape, realistic, master painter and art style of Noel Coypel, art of Émile Eisman-Semenowsky, art of Édouard Bisson


K_ueler_a, 20 steps, 7.5 guidance, normalize prompt weights, if you use them.


  

Put forest before landscape
  

Adding 12.0 guidance.
  

Bumping it up to 30 sampling steps
  

And bumping it finally to 50 sampling steps.
  
________________

IN CONCLUSION


There are a lot of things that go into creating good prompts. It can be difficult to know what to create and how to create. As this technology moves forward, though, we will get better at not only understanding it, but helping each other understand it.
        These are some of my favorite ways that I solved the issue. Some of them are definitively different then the originals, but I still like the results enough to post them.
        Quick note: use textless at the beginning to remove text. :)

You can substitute fruit or landscapes and it will pretty much still pop out stuff. Just pay attention to the guidance/samplers/cfg/whatever you’re calling whatever, samplers/steps, etc.

________________
SAMPLERS, A DEFINITIVE STUDY:




        A lot of people have done wonderful work regarding samplers. With new updates coming each week, it can be hard to keep up, much less understand what each sampler does.This is why I have chosen to do a deep, definitive study beyond, “Oh, hey, a shiny picture of varying degrees!”
        For the integrity of the study, I have chosen to use a lot of my own PERSONAL work for it, simply because I know where it came from, and I’m perfectly happy to modify my own work.


I’ll be re-writing this later. When I feel like it. -11/4/2022


Please note that most images were created with 1.4 for this study. (Ones created with 1.5 have been noted.)

1 - STARTING WITH A PAINTING:


        I began this study with a piece of art that I completed around the 1st of February of 2017. I chose this painting, not only because I created it, and I would feel a little weird using someone else's' art and it would be against Google’s ToS, but I wanted a specific style to start with. I felt that this was sort of a digital oil painting style and this would fit a lot of styles that people would be looking for.
        Also, I want to be clear that I made these images without GUFFGUHPAHNG installed.
        I know that I could have made this painting better, as my skills have improved. However, I chose to leave the painting as-is in the nature of just wanting to see what the AI could do with it. 
        


  

Feb 1, 2017, SAI, Corel Painter Essentials 4, Photoshop CC 2017, Cintiq DTF-521


portrait of an old thief in a blue hood with a gray beard, in a dark forest at night, realistic, digital oil painting


Beginning with img2img, I used the phrase listed above; I wanted to make sure that this study was as consistent as possible, so I will be laying out each part of the study, and how I went about doing each section of the study.
I previously mentioned why I was doing this study, but for the uninitiated, it's because I want to know, yo!
My goal was to test both its replication in oil, interpretation of faces, how it would stylistically change the facet, etc. 
The first page is four images of each sampler, except for the one in which I screwed up, but let’s pretend that I didn’t screw that up, shall we?
Each image is iterative with a random seed.

* K_lms
   * I find the first image to be one of the most interesting, as it’s the only one here with a white trim. However, as you’ll see with other results, it’s pretty clear–and easy to speculate–that the reason was/is because of the clergy. I can only assume that people wearing that kind of attire would be associated with a hood, and that proved to be accurate, which you will actually see in the other images later on down the line.
   * There are also two saturated blue/slight purple hoods here, with both images having much more red in these images, whIch is what is causing that purple. It’s almost like having a red filter applied, but not quite. This is more apparent with the two images in the top, since the skin seems to have been given a more ruddy appearance.
   * The bottom left is the most accurate, following my image the closest. There are a lot of hard deep lines here, and it seems to be referencing my lines but also accentuating the detail.
      * We have to consider its references, but we can tell that it tried to follow my biggest shapes/sections to mimic it. Despite them being incredibly different, you can still see it followed the path of the lips, eyebrows, etc. I believe this is true for the other samplers as well.
   * In terms of brush strokes, most of them are harder strokes. But they are kind of a little waxy/oily looking. (Yes, I know, oil painting, but this isn't the same technique.)
   * For some reason, it had an affinity for changing the eye color, which is something that I noticed for the others as well.
   * The last image seems to have taken more of a yellow approach, using my undertones to complete the image.
   * The bottom right is a little out of left field but it does have that rim lighting. 
* DDIM
   * I feel this one truly emphasizes oil paintings/old masterworks. It's got the roundness and fullness of color transitions that are both smooth and realistic. 
      * For reference, there was a time where making your paintings as soon as possible on the canvas was a thing. 
      * Painting typically leaves some kind of texture, so to be able to have a smooth canvas takes a lot of work.
      * The brush strokes in general, and their transitions are a lot more subtle.
   * The colors are all less saturated and more realistic here. 
   * I feel like DDIM here kind of has a blend of techniques, because while they all have these details, you get the sense that the word oil is giving it this sort of smudged look. 
   * As with most things, though, it doesn't always hit the mark. The top right has some potential but it's got some issues with the lighting. 
      * You could counter with saying generate more and that's absolutely true, no doubt there.
* K_dpm_2_a
   * The contrast in these images is much deeper. There's still the realistic feel that we have with DDIM, but one of the faces is turned, with the skin color changing quite drastically. The undertones are a lot more ash and the small little marks are deep and unnerving.
      * Which brings me to the following conclusion: each sampler is set to deal with the dataset(s) in particular ways.
      * You should be able to use any sampler but that doesn’t mean they don’t have strengths/weaknesses.  
   * The eyes are darker, the faces a little seedier, and for some odd reason, two of the eyebrows have been absorbed
      * …Aliens.
      * Yes. That's my final conclusion, officer!
   * We also see that the range between values is narrowed. The light is just so much stronger in those two images, which doesn’t leave for a lot of room for those other tones.
   * It’s also fairly yellow.
* K_dpm_2
   * What gets me here is that these are all so stylized in mostly this very oily look. Everything just has a very “I’m bold, I’ve got my shapes aligned, and this is what I’m doing, boss!” look to it.
   * This one has a mix of red and yellow for the skin, neither going straight for what I created, nor straying too far from it. Instead, it is attempting to blend, rather than going exactly for what I created. Which really speaks to how SD works in general overall—which, if you don’t understand already, I suggest you take the time to read about, because it’ll help you understand how we can get better at learning about this technology.
* K_euler_a
   * I have observed this sampler quite a bit and it seems to be one of the most fantasy-oriented and you get so much bang for your buck! 
   * The brush strokes here are very soft, with a lot of blended/smudged strokes. What's happening here is really something like the artist puts down a bunch of very fine strokes. (Or not fine, since I used my phone lol.) Then, the artist uses a smudge or watercolor or such brush to pull the digital paint around. (I made it a lil softer on the left, more detail on the right.) So then you have a bunch of details in the strokes without really doing 110% effort. This is actually a really great technique for picking up environmental color as an artist. 
* K_euler
   * I like that it picks up pieces from the ancestral version, but also carries part of that oily feel from a lot of the other images.
   * We really have a mixed batch here, with each one having its own say. They’re more generalized, but do capture quite a bit of detail in the strokes at the same time.
   * It's like you see this gradual learning over time, which is something that I find fascinating. You can see it actively trying to re-create, yet NOT re-create the image at the same time. 
      * I want to make another note here.
      * Something I find quite interesting is that I have a character that is a yellow wolf. When I first got SD, and during the beta, I made a bunch of yellow wolves, along with some of very specific characters because I was going for some icons.
      * Now, what's weird to me is that, every now and then, if I am putting in words like Pomeranian, and not even including yellow, and it will straight up just pop out characters that look like that. I am not telling it to do this--it's doing it on its own. 
      * It actually gave me pause and led to part of this study because it happened quite a few times when there was no reason that I could find that it should have.
* K_huen
   * Huen is probably one of the ones I find the most unique. It has the capacity to do these wonderful fantasy scenes, but usually with more steps. That said, it also does a lot of really good realistic scenes as well, so it’s kind of this blend and I can’t quite put my finger on the way to describe it (yet.)
   * But I think this is a really good example of its capacity because it has a wide breadth of styles that work well with it from smooth styles to very finite detailed ones. 
   * We’ll explore this further below.


Throughout all the pictures, we see slight changes in variance, from the hood to facial structure. We can also see that the more detailed faces have a similar look. Again, we can see that the way that the model is trained matters.
I also changed the steps to 50 and the guidance to 7.5.


Pg 2 


  





Just to be clear, I will be making references to each portion of these studies as we go through, because I think it's important to actually support my theories or thoughts/observations. (I might make references to future material, even if it isn't posted, too, so please keep this in mind.) 
And, I just want to be clear that while I’m writing these things, especially when it’s late, ahahahahahahahaha, or when I’m not done, I might make mistakes. I do try to make sure everything is thorough when I’m done with a section. So if I miss something, I’ll try to make sure everyone is aware. So, please just be aware of that when something is a WIP. 




* K_lms
   * What I find interesting here is that the hoods are really different. We really didn’t see that a whole lot with the first batch.
   * The chin (bottom right) just being over the neck and jutting out with the hair in that realistic feeling is somewhat surprising. The fine little details 
   * Once again, you have this somewhat oily look, which isn't so much...oil as it is a paint-by-number project. That said, this feels a little less blended than the first, with more details being present overall as a trade-off. But I wouldn’t say that this is 100%, as it’s up to conjecture in terms of what you like.
      * That said, I feel that having more steps really is going to give you more of what you want if you’re looking for something more realistic, and I think that this leans in that direction.
   * Secondly, three out of the four have an exceptionally hard shadow to the nose. Each follows the deep shadow on the cheek. We see a similar contrast in the past one, yet here his forehead wrinkles have multiplied. If he had any more wrinkles, his forehead would fall over his eyes. 
* DDIM
   * With DDIM, we see that the forms are much more clear. It’s no longer just about the underlying shapes—instead we see that the details are starting to appear. You can now see the tiny bits of the beard, including the shadows underneath, which I find a finite detail—there’s a lot that SD picks up. 
   * Although the eyes were present in the previous one, there’s a lot more clarity to be had here. 
   * I’d also like to state that a lot of these images are picking up a lot of the surrounding color—that is to say that what is happening irl with white/gray is actually happening here, which is a nice touch, and something to remember/recall when it comes to any kind of image generation/art. We can also see that the hairs and lines are directional, which is another detail—SD can follow along lines, which is more than apparent in a lot of work with SD.
   * As far as the hoods go, I’d have to say that the previous ones work a little bit better, but each hood goes along with the style of the face. However, these are a lot brighter/have more lighting, so, again you have some variance/conjecture here.
   * We still see that desaturation.
* K_dpm_2_a
   * This is where I feel where SD just kind of “tried its hardest,” not to put it down in any way–of course not. Everything is fantastic, except bark dude in the corner. Which, to be fair, I didn’t have a fourth one last time, so this is repayment for my sins, I guess. 
   * We’re getting a lot more texture with this one here, which is an important thing to note–because what makes skin more realistic than texture? It’s the moles, the scars, the little bits and the creases that really make something unique and interesting. 
      * I think that this was somewhat apparent in the last one, because we have that haunting top right.
   * I do have to say, though, these seem a little bit “flatter,” but this could be an outlier, so I don’t want to say this for certain. That said, again, the skin is more realistic, the face is more realistic, which is what we’re seeing overall–better representation of the skin, hair, general creases in the face, etc. It’s all in the little things that make us so good at knowing whether or not something is real or right.
      * The hoods also have a lot more rim lighting, more than likely just from following the prompt more.
   * Pretty sure the guy with the light on his beard is an ice wizard.
   * There’s also more variety in the noses, which I find to be…scintillating, to be sure.
* K_dpm_2
   * Get out of here with your clown face, sir! Seriously. Out! The way his lips are…are inexcusable. And his eyelashes. Get an eyelash kit if you’re going to have those kinds of lashes. 
   * I would say here the shapes are a lot more blended. The brushstrokes seem to be longer and more painterly. This could be because it’s trying to mimic my own style, or simply because of how SD interprets data. Regardless, the beards all have their own little squiggles in them now instead of these straight lines, which is much different from the previous samplers we’ve seen.
      * So this gives us a question to ask: if we see that k_dpm_2 has all these squiggles, does that mean it could potentially be incredibly good at creating/interpreting fractal art? Regardless of what the AI may or may not know?
   * We see more saturation this time–reds and yellows.
   * Again, the shadows here are reduced, but the overall realism has changed.
   * The facial expressions are more consistent with the guidance, following my expression more closely in my work.
* K_euler_a
   * He has a butt for a chin. At least he has butt ambient lighting. And no, just because I'm old doesn't mean I'm above butt jokes. I didn't make them as a kid, so the time is NOW.
      * Honestly, this shows off this sampler's tendency to be very unique and saturated.
   * This one has more shadows, I think, and highlights the forms of the nose and the cheekbones.
      * I'd like to take a moment to pause and actually talk about facial structure. The bottom right looks like he has a bout of endetulous-aka- no chompers. (I would know, seeing as I also have none.)
      * When you're considering creating someone old, they may or may not have teeth. Your jaw ends up resting, which isn't always relaxed, kind of above where your upper teeth would be without dentures. It's a little bit weird but it certainly shortens the jaw/ face, and it's a lot more comfortable. Personally, mine kind of juts a little bit out, so I sorta resemble a fish. Without the teeth, your cartilage shortens, (but in my experience, not too much), so you have some kind of form but it's diminished.
      * Anyway, this info can give you information about things that may or may not be in the dataset(s), and, if you're willing to take time to observe what you are creating, you just might learn more about art or how to refine what you are creating.
         * For example, strong characters are often portrayed with sharp angles, boxy chins, etc.
   * Another observation here is that the expressions have certainly improved. He no longer looks like he's about ready to run for the hills in every frame. Which reminds us to carefully consider expressions while we are creating prompts.
   * Overall, I believe this is an improvement.
* K_euler
   * My favorite theory for the man on the right is that he got a lipstick that smelled like one of those super fruity ones from the 90’s and it just got away from him. Either that or it turned out like this…
   * I'm also haunted by the way the man on the top left has turned, like he's just decided he's done being part of this painting and now he's coming for you.
      * The realism is stunning but the desaturation hinders it while also turning up the creep factor…which begs the question: how does each sampler look at color, in general, and determine hue, value, and saturation?
   * The faces are all into the hoods here, too. ….West side! We actually had a similar effect with the last sampler, only this one is more realistic with its depth.
   * In terms of the general style, I feel that this is pretty soft/smooth/ reliable/consistent, at least for these.
      * In general, I find these samplers to be fairly consistent for anything fantasy related, and they seem to have an easier time picking things up than other samplers in img2img. (The mermaid is the best example of this.)
   * Lastly, we have hair loss. (Yes, we see thinning in others.) But I find it pretty…glob-smacking…that we have the capability to see such variety.
* K_huen
   * I don't like these. No. The top right guy is a weasel and the shadow is a mite weird there but we'll survive looking at it.
   * I really like k_huen because it's really on-point for realism but it has these little spicy quirks, which just seem to give it its own personality. (At least, that's my impression at this point in time.)
   * It picked up the short and long hairs and once again, it tried to go along with the flow of my painting.
   * Frankly, I find the realism impressive - and I think this would be a great way to learn to stretch yourself as an artist. 
      * Struggling with something? Put it into img2ing as a reference and learn to get better.
   * And although we had some cool texture in the last images, (and even a somewhat realistic one, to be fair), the quality difference is pretty high.
* Yes…
   * I'm aware I didn't comment on the background because I have better pictures for that.
* Overall
   * Take note of the saturation, desaturation, change in value, etc- we'll be coming back to these later.




For this next part of the study, I went through each of the samplers, two times each, refreshed, moved the images into a folder away from SD, etc, just to see if it made any impact. For the sake of ease, though, I’ve just clumped them together in a grid. 
(As I mentioned previously, I kind of wondered what was going on with the random character interjection. As I have noted with animals, SD will often just color a dog or cat rather than change the breed, so I feel like there is something that we are fundamentally missing here--and that is the relationship of specifics, which I already addressed in my Old Masters tutorial.)
(Also, I actually did the “No Name, No Shame” first, but I figured it was better to put this part here first.)


Pg 3


  



        Frankly, I think that this really just…confirms my earlier suspicions and thoughts on the matter, to some degree. I’ll explain. 


* K_lms
   * Legend has it, when the four Men of the Four Giant Foreheads attacked, there were no longer any doorframes to be had! Captain Bluebeard (bottom left) was especially fierce--his weary eyes make you slam into a pillow so hard you were napping until next week! Thankfully, Senior No-chin (top left) was immune to this apocryphal damage, having absorbed far too many carbs over his lifetime. The Whistler (no relation, bottom right) and his shadowy organization of would-be troupe dancers were one step away from assassinating you..
      * …
      * The top right? We don't talk about that guy.
   * In comparison, the shadows seem softer. Looking at the past entries, I feel like starting with a fresh slate may be a boon. This one popped out more realistic images, but, again, we’d have to actually make more images in a row, I think. However, from what I can tell here, we’ve managed to create more smooth transitions. 
      * If you look at all the images in general, it appears that most of the smudge-like painterly strokes have been removed in favor of a smoother, softer-transitioned look.
   * * DDIM
   * My favorite one here is that monochromatic face with that look all adults get when they’ve had enough of that Monday.
   * We’re still seeing the same kind of saturation with the yellow going on–just in a different vox, which is still another sign that we need to be cognizant of color and how the sampler is going to interpret the colors within the image. 
   * This time we have more of that rim lighting, as if the images had been swapped with the first. They are relatively similar in quality, so you could do this method, or not.
* K_dpm_2_a
   * Oddly, we see a little bit of treebark’s return here, which is a little weird. But here we are, and once again, we have a mix of styles, and it’s on par with the last one.
* K_dpm_2
   * I would say that these turned out better, but, again, this needs more testing to confirm. I’m going to guess it doesn’t matter at this point.
* K_euler_a
   * There’s no real difference here, but it’s like butt-chin finally grew a majestic beard.
   * We still see a lot of personality with the noses, so there’s still something we can take away, which is the continued advances in stylistic choices.
* K_euler
   * The cat eyes here startling—which makes me wonder–what kind of eyes can we see? How about pupils, etc?
* K_huen
   * The way chins just in or out awkwardly makes me wonder how many people are wandering around with chins that could be used as shovels. Is there a cult of the shovel-chins I’m missing?
      * I’m sure this can be aggravating, but thankfully, you can mask/adjust, etc.
   * The race is still pretty close, so the gap is only in the fine details. However, it seems to be producing more detailed images.
* CONCLUSION:        
      * Inconclusive….probably doesn’t matter/doesn’t make a difference. 




        I would say, with a sweeping gesture, that we have learned some general information about these samplers, that moving them doesn’t jack, that guidance really matters and will make it try to follow our image regardless of the sampler, etc.

2 - NO NAME, NO SHAME


With my study far from over, I embarked on what I will call an absolutely hysterical campaign. Ready for the slaughter I was about to behold, I slapped my art into img2img, didn’t bother to write anything, waiting with a bucket of internal smelling salts for the disaster that was going to happen. And 2 by 2, it arrived. 
Img2img is very useful, and now that DSL has img2img, there’s a good opportunity for people who have not had a chance to test this technology to use it.
And, obviously, I think it stands to reason to point out that beyond the samplers, that these are also studies in prompts, as well as an insight into things like img2img.
The point of this part was simply to see what it would come with–would it follow my picture? What was in the database? What can we learn from this prompt? What kind of valuable information would it show?
So let’s take a look. (For reference, I will straight up be ignoring if they look like certain people.)




-Pg 1, or 4, if you will-


Click for a larger preview; please note these were NOT fixed by GFPGAN.


  





* K_lms
   * In the first row, we can observe the following information:
      * Raincoat.
      * Ballcap/baseball uniform/weather jacket.
      * All of these materials reflect something shiny, which means that in this particular case, it went for something rather realistic and down to earth. Perhaps it figured since the colors were dark, and it was very shiny, that the material would be from a rainy night. And think that’s really what the sampler went for with all of these images. Not one of these materials reflects a hood whatsoever.
      * This tells us that:
         * Most references when it comes to humans are likely going to be pulled from photos, as those are the likely sources that they are going to be trained from.
         * Unless you plan on making a piece of art that is stylistic, you will need to guide SD by planning ahead and letting it know that you want something artistic. 
   * Let’s observe the skin tone, shadows, and general facial features.
      * Here, it did just fine for the skin tone. I think the first is probably the most realistic. (I’m not entirely sure where it got the glasses, but it’s pretty creative and I like it.)
      * The shadows, since these are photos, are pretty good. There’s not a whole lot to complain about here. 
      * Yes, the second one is odd; his left eye is having a party—or maybe it’s his right, like my right eye. Ah, amblyopia. It wouldn’t be so bad if his teeth were fixed.
         * But, again, these issues can be adjusted with GFPGAN, in-painting, masking, etc. As SD evolves, and more training is done, these features will, of course, improve.
      * In terms of beards, I think it’s interesting that the ball cap dude has a close shave. I’m sure this is likely due to how he looks in general in terms of how SD was trained.
         * Notice how the other bears have the hairs and how the first one kind of has these little pieces that curve around. It should be noted that the AI can absolutely wrap around curves, lines, features, etc, and create a 3D sort of presence within a piece. However, it appears the first fellow has someone blowing a dryer towards his beard alone.
         * There’s some sort of filtering going on (4th) and some variance in the 3rd piece as well. 
   * Backgrounds
      * There’s not a whole lot here, but there’s a lot of blur/depth of field.
   * Overall, most of these seem to be realistic/photos.
* DDIM
   * Bam! Three out of four are like paintings. 
      * The first, oddly, seems like an unfinished painting, and I’m not really sure why that is. It’s kinda weird, ngl, but it could be due to the way that SD has trouble with eyes, at times. 
   * MATERIALS
      * The first is sheer. That’s what I find unique; the fact that there’s some opacity here, and a great deal of folds–it’s kind of cool, almost like a hat. There’s also these little buttons going on. Either that or they’re balloon ends–you decide!
      * The second has two types of materials, which is a reminder that you can combine all types of materials. Why is the second part dirty—I hope that’s not puke—and why is the top so clean? The difference in specularity/softness is somewhat cool. 
      * As for three...While his hood may look like it was made out of a quality sleeping bad, at least it looks comfortable.
      * This is a cross between realism and being a painting, which is something I think it's going for in general. The style for the piece itself is consistent, which is good--you want whatever you are working on to be consistent.
      * For four…This one actually looks like mylar is woven into the material. Either that or he put reflective tape on so he could call for his home planet.
         * The shadows are a little off but I'm glad it picked up the general idea about the lighting.
         * The addition of the zipper is kind of cool. Again, that’s another note–zippers, jackets, etc–all things we can generate. 
   * FACES
      * Again, all of these faces are fairly realistic, like many of the other samplers. However, in comparison with what we have already studied, you can tell that there’s really a lot of variety, and though that’s just in general with all of these, most of these are kind of bulbous. I actually really like the round style and it honestly works for this character, since having a big honking nose was part of the jam.
         * Adults do have bigger noses, even though with a lot of styles, and to make people seem more feminine, they might be drawn more slender. However, they are actually pretty large, and this is something to keep in mind.
      * The first also has some scars on the nose, and the beard is more uniform, with the hairs being kept neat and short. You can tell a lot about a man by how he keeps his beard, mayhap? His is neat, prim, and proper, which actually goes with the whole aesthetic.
      * For the second, I don’t know why the proportions are so off, but they’re disturbing, because there’s just no way his face should be like that. Or it could be that he has….cat…eyes…? No eyes? However you want to classify them. 
         * Yes, there are many different types of skulls. Studying various types of skulls can also teach you a lot.
         * The hair in the beard is very wild and tangled, which adds a lot of personality. Even if we are artists, having a reminder is not a bad thing. Asking yourself why something is compelling can bring out new ideas you might not have previously thought possible.
         * The pose has slightly shifted as well here, which is very important for acknowledging our center line.
      * For number three, the sunglasses are just my jam. One of my favorite parts is the frosted eyebrows and ginger beard. Either he witnessed his way into that outfit, or he had a bad hair dye job. Either way, considering the hair was adjusted, we get to see a little of that red influence that pops outta nowhere.
         * The shadow does follow the glasses, so we now know that we can test out faces with sunglasses--this might be something to pursue in a study.
         * It also looks like there are two glasses instead of just one.
         * The brushwork and lighting are fairly straightforward, with the lighting being fairly consistent but feeling more complex on the material.
         * The lips also deviate, which isn’t something I got into a whole lot previously but it is something that I wanted to mention.
      * For fours' features, he fits the description of a crazy old coot, and I approve. His teeth and jaw are misaligned, his cheeks don't quite make sense with that witch's crook of a nose…No wonder his eyes are the way they are! I'm pretty sure I hear some crazy, "Heh heh heh!" As he's bent over with a straw in a corner in an alleyway on Taco night. R/oddlyspecific
         * He shaved off part of his beard. Once again, styling beards, and considering how we should apply facial hair, and playing with various kinds of facial hair is becoming an interesting part of this study.
         * The teeth here are of a fairly natural color, and while misaligned, that gives it more of a natural look. 
         * Again, we do have somewhat of a combo between realism and a soft paint overlay going on.
   * BACKGROUNDS
      * Two of the backgrounds are relatively void of detail. The other two seem to have more detail than the k_lms, with both kinds of leaning on the whole raining vibe still.
   * STYLE
      * Small presences in texture are observed.
      * Variance in materials. Just like in real life, we can change how light scatters across our objects, etc.
      * Painterly aspect, combined with realism, all without text guidance.
* K_dpm_2_a
   * I dub our children of this lot:
      * Burrito
      * Reject Buzz Lightyear
      * Smooth Earbuds
      * Bubba J
   * BURRITO
      * Burrito may look comfortable in his multi-layered material, which looks like a sleeping back. We’ve gone back to full realism, so I don’t think there’s a lot to really say on the matter here. 
   * REJECT BUZZ LIGHTYEAR
      * HONEY, WHERE DID YOU COME FROM!? I DON’T EVEN—WOW. Just. What? I actually really like the rapid, sudden, crazy insane change in style. 
         * Similar to k_euler_a, I’ve noticed this one will occasionally just pop out something wild and creative, on observance.
      * The amount of hodge-podge materials, the look as if there was just some kind of glass over copper, or whatever—I’m digging it, for sure.
      * The eyes kind of freak me out, though. That and the eyebrows. They’re kind of intense.
         * Also, the facial expression is somewhat similar to the first.
      * The texture of the skin is very soft without a whole lot of texture, which is kind of weird but I think it works with the rest of the image.
   * SMOOTH EARBUDS
      * When I saw this, I started laughing and crying. I couldn’t handle it. I just could not fathom why the hell there were EARBUDS COMING OUT OF HIS NECK, ONTO HIS FACE. HE WAS LISTENING TO SOMETHING CHILL, AND HAD CHARISMA, THOUGH.
         * I’m not sure why the top looks like spiderwebs. Your guess is as good as mine. 
      * Once again, we’re back to the sleeping back/hood sort of look that doesn’t really quite fit the rob genre.
      * The expression change was also a bit of a startle to me, but, again, since we didn’t tell it to do anything, it really just did what it wanted. And this is really good for prototyping if you just want to get an idea for something.
   * BUBBA J
      * Seems like he’s had a tear over his beer, and why he is wearing a blue camo cap, I’ll never know, but he’s wearing a t-shirt, and his one eye is popping out…
         * The way his lips are pulled in, he might be ready to pull out a bat and whack me–I don’t know, but I’m not taking a chance.
         * This is probably the weirdest one in the lot to me, if only because it’s so emotional, which is why you shouldn’t be afraid to be emotional in your prompts. 
   * OVERALL:
      * Variance in style was wild.
      * Variance in texture was pretty unique.
      * Variance in facial expression, skin texture, like the others, still holds solid.
* K_euler_a
   * I used to like you, k_euler_a. But that first image is NSFL. I hope that’s a crayon. 
   * While we could go through these one by one, let’s, instead, point out our observations, since we already know that k_euler_a is very good at doing out of the box creative stuff:
      * Changes in patterns, color, adding WILD changes in facial structure, including throwing patterns, different kinds of clothing, poses, etc. You are just throwing a wild card in there. I think everything kind of speaks for itself here, so I will leave it at that, generally speaking.
   * Otherwise:
      * How the cloth turns folds in the first and wraps around the shoulders and head has a lot more presence.
      * The use of turning the cloth into hair is quite the twist.
      * The glasses really have a sci-fi look and they look familiar but I can’t place them in my head. There’s several things floating in my head about this…
      * The dunce cap and painterly look, along with the hoity-toity look, the addition of saturation/redness just give this an absurd look…
      * I’ve noticed a trend here, too, of adding these sorts of…hard areas with hard edges, and within those edges, you have these blurred, or soft spaces. It’s just like…all part of that process of how it’s put together, piece by piece, almost like a cutout, in some ways, stylistically. It looks like he had a hood just shopped over his face.
      * ….uh…no. Not sure where that nightmare came from, but no. Creative, but, no. 
         * The pallbearer look is really creepy. 
         * I’m pretty sure this is a really messed up face, as you can see it underneath, like it was in the middle of making a face and went, TIME FOR A GOLD AND RED BUTTERFLY!
      * Is that…drool? I’ve been wondering this whole time. Is it? Is it not? Who’s with me? Poll time. Who thinks it’s drool? I just don’t know.
         * That hair, though. Sign me up for that shampoo! It’s soft, it’s painterly. It’s got volume. Mm! Only it looks fake, sadly.
         * Sidenote, too: His suit is tinted blue, another facet of AI stuff: tinting things!


Thought we were done, huh? Nah! We got another page of this rigamaroll!  


Pg 2 (or 5!)


  



* K_euler
   * Like its great ancestor, euler has its mind set on creativity, changes in pattern, color, and texture.
   * FOR ONCE, we ACTUALLY get hoods, except the last guy. He only semi-qualifies. Sorry, Dave, we appreciate your low-cost cosplay, and will allow you to be part of the group, but NO.
   * All of these faces have a little bit of motion blur/blur to them, which makes them a little bit difficult to see.
   * All of these take on that photo realism look. At this point, I have to say maybe it's the easiest thing for the AI to do; or it's just the priority of the weights.
      * I want to mention this, because a lot of you may not have realized this, but there are some things that do have priority over others. It’s a fine thing to deal with, and there are a lot of ways to go about dealing with it. But the important thing to remember is that sometimes, practice is just required. And that some tools, or finessing may be required to get what you want. People will continue to make tools, tutorials, and SD will continue to grow and to get better. I think that’s something that people need to keep in mind is that as we move forward, things will continue to get better.
   * ON STYLE
      * The first guy has the most fantasy vibe out of all of them in terms of the hood, if only because there’s some kind of lace, but I suppose that’s opinion-related.
      * The third guy here is really quite distinct, and reminiscent of some kind of post processing blurred-lineart-partial pointillism overlay over video and I LOVE it. It's a very artsy feel, which, once again, I urge you to remember and ask yourself--is this variance being seen with other samplers?
         * I think we can safely say that as we look through each of the images in these studies that we DO see patterns.
      * Lastly, why does Dave have bags under his right eye, but not his left? It’s always fun to notice these little inconsistencies, but being able to spot them makes you a better artist, no matter where your level is at.
         * That’s something you should keep in mind—no matter where you are as an artist, whether that’s a professional, or you’re just starting out, or just somewhere wildly in between just doing your own thing—being able to observe your mistakes and learn from them will fundamentally make you better. 
         * Why? To see a mistake is to know what is wrong. To know what is wrong is to be able to ask a question. And being able to ask a question means you can go out into the world and find the answer. There are millions…gazillions…of artists through the centuries, and in there here and now…and they can help you. You’re not alone–never be afraid to ask for help.
         * Your eyes, your ears, who you are, and how you experience the world–this data that you experience in the day to day–is a tool. 
         * Learn to observe everywhere you go. Doing this will change your perception. Not only will you be able to spot what’s wrong in your own work, but you can recognize what’s better in other people’s work so that you can mimic and learn from it. After all, humankind is a collective, collaborative effort, after all. We are nothing without each other. 
* K_heun
   * Oh, my, my goodness. Ladies and gents, I believe we need some more…steps. Some more…baking…some more…SOMETHING. 
   * Heun, as you will see in other studies below, is doing the old make everything yellow and desaturated, even now.
   * 3/3 did not pass inspection, though. Augh! 
      * All of these seem to be focusing on the lower lip area, and that’s where it mostly goes wrong, I think.
      * I do have to say the addition of the hair is not a step in the wrong direction, though.
      * However, I do have to say that the sort of muddy painting here really worked out well in terms of idea. It may not have worked in form but I like the concept. 
      * The last guy’s face is very compelling, especially his eyes, which is difficult for SD to use. (GFPGAN actually really helps with this aspect.)
   * I’d have to say that it did a pretty good job at making some very good portraits. It really went out of its way to do something that stood out for each one, which is, again, something to note down for future reference.
* K_dpm_k_2
   * Here, we see a kind of a breakdown. Which is why we need to remember that just because we have a “bad set” of images doesn’t mean that the sampler is bad, or that our image is bad, but that maybe we need to tweak some settings, maybe we need to push our guidance/cfg/whatever down/up, tweak our steps, change our keywords, etc. We can always use a seed to generate more images, so it’s not like we can’t progress, and it’s not like you NEED to make the first image perfect–the more you iterate and work on something, the more personal a connection you will have with that piece. Building that kind of relationship with that piece brings out that artistry in you, so you shouldn’t take any of these images as, “this sampler is bad.”
      * Also, once again, we can use things like GFPGAN to adjust faces, too, if they get too crazy.
      * And, as always, you can use what I like to call a “stabilizer,” something–a reference, an artist style, etc, to help make the image have more coherency. 
      * This is also why putting absolutely nothing can make something beautiful as well as something…awful. Because it’s just random.
   * Even though these images are really out there, we can see that SD really did try to make things pretty captivating…although the last guy looks like a t-rex blew its nose on him. It's like it tried to put glasses on him, again, but it got all caught up with the eyebrows and then the face got folded into the hood, which clearly makes him an alien. Okay, maybe that makes him from MIB.
   * Conclusion: 
      * Blurring, texture, blending into 3D forms–all aspects of SD that we see SD having problems with are present here, but all problems we can also work on/resolve, etc.
* K_euler
   * This was an accident, but why not include it!?
   * Why do I get the feeling the third guy is going to shyster me out of something? He’s about to talk to me about the Dimmsdale Dimmadome, I’m sure…..
   * This speaks for itself…AHAHAHAHHAHA…


CONCLUSION


A lot of these were unexpected but also within the range of acceptability. It really gives us an idea about what kind of noses, facial structures, etc, are in the database. And that's really something to continually keep in mind--it's as good as what it is trained on as a base! But we can always help that grow through fine tuning and textual inversion, as well as use features like inpainting and outpainting to improve overall fidelity.
Each of these really does seem to have their own kind of style, such as adding grain, texture, types of materials. We also need to remember that img2img and just generating matters as well. All of this matters.




BREAKDOWN
What did we learn? (IN GENERAL)


* K_heun
   * Is actually really good at pulling off some realistic vibes, which you’ll see in later studies.
   * Can do some very clear-cut, tight images. I think clarity is what I think of when I see k_huen.
* K_euler
   * Has a lot of variety, and will do its best to simulate fantasy-based works.
   * Like its ancestor, it causes a lot of red, etc, but is more refined. Seems a little more realistic but this requires more testing to confirm.
   * Has a wide range of capacity for color.
* K_euler_a
   * A for ancestral, so it’s like its fam.
   * Adds a lot of saturation, and changes the hue, often in the red spectrum. 
   * Brightens the image.
* K_dpm_2
   * Is a wild card, in my experience. This is the person you bring to the party when you want things to get fun.
   * Seems to be pretty good at making sci-fi material–this requires further testing to prove this.
   * Creates deep contrast. 
* K_dpm_2_a
   * A for ancestral, so it’s like its kin.
   * Was pretty grainy/had a bark-like texture for img2img.
* Plms
   * Wasn’t applicable for this part of the study, but I’m mentioning it exists.
* DDIM
   * Desaturates the forms, tends to make things pretty yellow.
   * Has a tendency to try to mediate and find some middle ground. This includes closing the gap in values, but this is situational
* K_lms
   * Likes to be realistic, but is robust and seems to handle all kinds of images. However, I can’t say that it’s entirely perfect, and the default and perfection of everything. 
   * Is good at picking up color/light from surrounding objects.




For now, we’ll keep it at that! This is mainly because while we have discussed the various styles and how it chose to create brush strokes, paint styles, etc, I want to make sure that we’re covering the appropriate ground at the appropriate time, and there are more studies I have completed that answer more questions for us!
________________
3 - ITERATIVE, BUT DEFINITIVE


  

Blender, SAI, Photoshop 2017, Paintstorm Studio, & Cintiq DTF-521




        For this particular part of my study, I wanted to use a piece with both 2D and 3D elements. (In this particular case, I believe that I added the 2D after, but sometimes I combine them together and render them. I’m not entirely sure.) I wanted to see how it would interpret the 2D and 3D elements, and how it would respond if I changed the sampler every two times. (In truth, this is because I started doing oil paintings of ducks with googly eyes that devolved into horrifying, terrifying iterative works until gradually all of the images just became giant googly eyes. It compelled me to want to know why SD felt so...STRONGLY about these googly eyes...why it turned my duck into having six pupils, etc.)
        For notation, there’s three columns going straight down and going to the next column in order. I wanted to be as literal as possible, so I went with this phrase the entire time:


2D furry wolf and dragon hybrid in sitting on a balcony of a 3D house, Blender and photoshop, hdr, highly detailed, hand painted




Please click on the image for a higher resolution
  



        
I’m going to break each section into three parts: the figure, the background, and the overall style of the piece. The painting styles, frankly, are…are over the place, so I won’t be covering them too much, because it’s more about the keywords, the data, and then




* K_lms
   * THE FIGURE
      * The blend of fur/brushstroke styles and giving the fur little whorls is somewhere between “I don’t know what style you’re going for” and “at least it looks like a wolf.”
         * I think it tried to use hands for the front paws, since I’ve noticed that it seems to have difficulty with furries. 
         * In almost all werewolves, etc, it almost always does more human than wolf and the transition just seems to be rough.
         * The symmetry helps.
         * At least it picked up the colors.
         * Even though the one ear is larger, the quirk adds to the charm. I actually really like the art style of this wolf. 
         * There’s a little shadow under him, too, which is good. You don't always get that. Lighting can be really hard to get right, even as an artist, so having accurate shadows with an AI is a tall order indeed.
         * I am a little disappointed, but considering the nightmares to come, he's not so bad.
      * The right figure sort of looks like a buzzcut fursuit, but I actually really like the pose. The colors, while the blue was picked up from the image, and doesn’t really match, is at least creative and within the confines of the style. So, I can appreciate the whole idea, at least. 
         * The multiple…ears? Are a little wild, though. And it’s something that I’ve noticed more prevalent in certain samplers. I’m not really sure why it added them here. 
         * At least we can tell it’s a wolf, but the way the hip is displaced tells a bigger story…a story that says….
         * WE NEED FINE TUNING FOR FURRIES, PEOPLE, AND I WILL TOTALLY DO IT, WHEN ABLE, BECAUSE I’VE DRAWN THOUSANDS OF SFW PICTURES OF FURRIES.
   * THE BACKGROUND
      * The clouds here have a puffy look, but the light around them on the left gives them a sense of style, as if someone took a blending brush to a photograph.
         * I really like how bright the sun is on the right.
      * We also see some rim lighting on the clouds and the windowsills, which adds to the feeling of depth. 
         * The perspective may be warped, but it’s still cool.
      * There’s a bit of a wrought iron thing going on with the windows, which I really like, and it picked up a little from my image, which you can see carried throughout as we go along.
      * The way the stone bleeds into each other is…odd, to say the least.
   * GENERAL STYLE
      * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
         * The clouds are realistically represented but slightly stylized.
         * There is 2D texturework, not quite 3D, but not quite 2D, either. It’s somewhat of a blend, much like what you might find in animation stills.
         * It has the feel of “photographs were used, lines were drawn” to create the materials. It genuinely does not have a 3D presence, although it has some amount of volume and perspective to give us the illusion that our character is sitting in a 3D space. 
         * The shadows have a sort of gradient to them, which is what gives them the slight amount of 3D feeling that can be appreciated.
         * Overall, I think the capacity of doing a 2D texture overlay, or very simple material of a 3D object…sorta? Could be used for the argument, if one ought to have an argument about such things.
         * The left image has lineart to it but the right doesn’t.
      * Did it pick the right palette?
         * I’d have to say that it tried, for the most part.
* K_huen
   * THE FIGURE
      * Either the fella on the left got smacked in the face, and thus, has acquired a very strange jaw, or, we’ve invented a new style of wolf. 
         * I think that it attempted to create some type of style, but, generally speaking, it really just tried to make a wolf with the colors that I had.
         * That’s really just something to keep in mind. If it doesn’t know what you want, it will make due with what you gave it and what it knows. And that’s why we have hand-paws. Because it isn’t seeing them as furries but as wolves with hands, not Disney-equse friends.
         * There's also the fact that, as you look at these, you can see that many of them are from the front, they look like timber wolves. So when you want to work on a particular animal or subject matter, it might be worth your while to explore that subject from all types of angles.
         * Also, no shadow. Nope!
   * THE BACKGROUND
      * Like the last, the clouds here are realistic, less stylized and more streaked/wispy. On the right, we see a similar secondary pattern of a red sky, though our sun has vanished.
      * The trees in the background sort of resemble a diorama paper and glue clippings. They're chunky, with a lot of noise, but the forms themselves are realistic enough.
      * Both railings have pretty good repetition, and relative spacing, but again we are dealing with an underlying blur, which we can reduce with steps, etc.
      * I would have to say that the foliage for both here is either similar to a matte painting, kind of like 2d adventure games, or just very cut-and-paste assets. I like it and it goes well together and I think SD did its best at emulating the style, but the lack of crucial color depth is a little unnerving. The shadows do help but it also has a sort of tacky nature to it at the same time. -2 for tacky. 
      * Once again, it went for the grainy 2D /let’s paste some textures onto the stone look.
         * The arch on the left has some odd opacity, and it just makes you want to do some spot removal/content aware/actually be watching the whole process unravel.
         * At least the left has some perspective, while the right looks like it has more of an orthographic viewpoint. There is a rock? I think? Behind the railing, but it’s so blurry that it’s just too hard to tell.
   * GENERAL STYLE
      * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
         * Perhaps we might blame this on the style of my own image of keywords, but this really didn't hit the mark. I think it TRIED, but it really just did not end up mixing these two elements together in a way that made sense.
         * The backgrounds were fine, but it failed the 3D part. The 2D part, in general, was fine, except where it straight up ditched the shadow. (Which, to be fair, could easily be adjusted.)
      * Did it pick the right palette?
         * It tried to adapt. The first has red on the character, at least.
         * It's very odd to me that not one of these got a relative close shot of a character on a balcony, but not one of them actually got the view right.They're all so focused on the red, with the green as the accent color, and the blues/teals just getting nixed out of existence.
         * And yes, obviously, we can mitigate any issues by changing out structure, adding in color palettes, etc!
* K_euler
   * THE FIGURE
      * Uh...your...teeth...grandma...they're...covered in strawberry jam O_O and coming out of your lower jaw, like a discount horror Balto.
      * The fur is really lovely. It picked up some of the brown colors, sunset lighting, it has one mutated hand, and somehow fat rolls under its neck. Considering I have fat rolls under my neck, though, who am I to judge?
      * The one on the right looks like it spawned from the Alaskan pits of a certain horror movie, has backwards front legs, and one giant spider butt.
         * The deep contrast does bring out the fur.
         * (The little streaks of light, though faint, are a nice touch. Sometimes everything is in the details.)
   * THE BACKGROUND
      * What I see here is that it picked up on the rust/iron immediately. It also placed the surrounding elements inside of the stone, which I appreciate. While it might have deviated from the sort of cobblestone form, it, at the very least, took the general idea and used the rules of perspective to beat that metal right into that.
      * Where that post apoc city came in the background, however, I’m not entirely sure. I suppose that one might assume that there were ruins involved, thus red and ruins equals the apocalypse. So, I wouldn’t be too surprised if this ended up being the reason.
         * Study the relationship of words–how do they interact? Always keep this in mind while making prompts, because you can learn a great deal. You may be wrong or right, but you can follow a hunch, and this can lead to new and interesting places you might not have otherwise meandered into.
      * On the right, it seems to have used the window arch and repeated it to create a bit of a fantasy archetype.
         * The lighting here is great.
         * You can really see how the figure impacted the bottom structure, sadly.
      * The mountains are really great, though, and it really has this cinemative feeling, so I actually really rather like the second image.
   * GENERAL STYLE
      * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
         * While the background has the smooth lighting, which gives it a 3D break, and sweeping aesthetic, and it is following the rules of perspective, it truly fails to combine 2D and 3D. 
         * That said, out of what we have seen so far, I think the left is a pretty strong candidate. The right also has perspective/lighting/shapes, but nothing here GENUINELY looks like it was rendered in a 3D modeling, etc. 3D is far more than just gradients that look good.The boards are pretty close, though, so you might argue and say, “Close enough for me!” and that’s totally passable and I get it.
         * Also, we’ve become lineless now.
      * Did it pick the right palette?
         * The right is better than the left. 
         * The colors in the background are kind of a swap?
* K_euler_a
   * THE FIGURE
      * Frankly, I think we know who lit the world on fire, and it most certainly was not a four-eyed, three-pawed fellow here. It was, more than likely, an accident with kale. 
         * He’s blue. 
         * His fur is pretty thicc. 
         * He’s a good boi, so pet him.
      * On the right, the texture was really nice–I love the brown, white, and gray.
         * The pose is pretty good.
         * I love the face because it really captures the wolf/cartoon style. The eyes are a nightmare, though. Training on such small things is difficult.
         * The paws are actually paws.
   * THE BACKGROUND
      * I know I said that it really didn’t get anything right, but I do have to say, on the right:
         * There is a window with red shutters here–the forms look far more 3D–it’s got plenty of color and light that’s being picked up. 
            * It’s fancy, and it’s got texture and elegance!
         * We also have shadows that look like they went beyond “press shift and move the mouse underneath this layer.” (Shift allows you to make a straight line in Photoshop, at least in the past. They change things, so, who knows what will happen in the future.) The paws of the figure are casting shadows, even though they’re wrong, they’re still appearing to cast them. 
         * There’s also the noise, the general texture, crispness, and ambient occlusion feeling here, which, to be fair, has been present in the others, but I have to say it’s been done really well here. 
      * On the left:
         * That little lantern is such a nice little touch. It took the glass from the image and made something out of it–nice. 
         * Why is the world on fire?
            * Again, post apoc? I’ve wondered about this ever since I created these images several weeks? A month or so ago? Whenever it was, roughly about the time SD was released, I think. I was speculating before, but the more I tested, the more I have come to realize that color association seems to matter. I could be wrong BUT HEY! THAT’S JUST MY THEORIES! Over here in SD Theories Land. I mean, color theory was relevant before, so why not now, right?
            * I also noticed during the beta that sunsets had this weird power to set things ablaze like a chaotic Elmo.This was because I saw it do it to landscapes, and I thought, "Alrighty then! Must have to do with red." Since SD wasn't giving me proper color association with animals, I figured it was doing something similar. 
         * I love the arch, though the lighting doesn’t make much sense. I like the whole “we made an arch of light up and down, but we put gaussian noise all over it in monochromatic ways,” and that’s about it. In some ways, it reminds me of sandstone.
   * GENERAL STYLE
      * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
         * The left:
            * Again, this really isn't 3D, as I previously explained. However I think the style of the picture is pretty seamless, so it's not like it's a bad result.
         * The right:
            * I really think the right really did a good job of this. The 3D in the background is great-but the extreme light on the figure doesn't really extend to the background.
            * Otherwise, though there isn't much interaction between the objects, I think this did pretty good.
      * Did it pick the right palette?
         * The left did a pretty good job.
         * The right, somewhat, but not as much.
* K_dpm_2
   * THE FIGURE
      * The left:
         * After I've stared at it, I've convinced myself it was trying to create a fennec fox. 
         * The hand over the railing is a nice touch and the paw could be taken for knuckles. 
         * The arm looks like it belongs to a sugar glider, or like it's someone wearing a jacket, but it's been turned into fur. 
            * The body looks like there is a leg that has been turned, which I give it props for simulating that. I think that it really tried to use a human base and put fur over it, which is something I have encountered before.
            * Again, if it's not in the database, you can still build it into being.
         * The face, while it reminds me of a plush that has been loved for far too long, the stuffing is uneven, it's been improperly washed, and has some kind of charm to it…even if its uneven eyes are questionable.
         * The lighting is very odd on the face, though. It makes it look like it is cut out.
      * The right.
         * I actually think the painterly wolf thing here is great.
         * It tried to give the wolf some human hips. There seems to be some werewolf association, which I can only assume, at least.
         * It did add a nice little bit of color to the tail.
         * The triangle underneath the eye looks like it was embossed.
            * This is another thing to consider-embossed cards, frames, all sorts of things of that nature. Raised prints, and all of that-this gives you an opportunity to be unique, photos of fabric and so forth, etc.
            * A lot of art pieces, especially anything remotely related to the masterworks, often bring up canvases, etc.
   * THE BACKGROUND
      * The left:
         * The whole idea of realistic clouds has been lost in this background.
         * There's a hint of the mountains, but it's like there's a lake in the background? I think that's what it is because you can't really see a water line; it's more like a floating mountain...just like when you Iook at the sea and see floating ships.
         * It's kept the circular arch theme that SD appears to like. I wonder why it seems so keen on these circular forms? Perhaps it has to do with priority, or maybe it's Alice in wonderland for all I know.
         * The leaves have some very nice bright green.
         * There's some random light coming from the left, right, as well as from behind. It doesn't entirely make sense, as with most of these.
      * The right:
         * Is that what I think it is in the background with a camera and a shell?
         * Honestly, it reminds me of those old 90's paintings that claimed to be "3D" by using illusion techniques to do some very trippy looking paintings.
         * I think this one did a really good job of trying to mimic my own design using color, presentation, etc.
         * The good use of perspective opens up the door and gives it more presence. Again, though, perspective itself is not the "3D" that we are looking for…but the way the red brick goes back, how the leaves frame the picture, and the door... thing… is behind the wolf makes for a really good composition.
         * The wood, brick, and greenery really do match up.
      * Both of the railings are similar and evenly spaced. I like that the second had texture added to it.
   * GENERAL STYLE
      * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
         * The right looks more like an oil painting.
         * The left-I'm not sure where to classify it. 
      * Did it pick the right palette?
         * It did well enough. 
         * Again, I've addressed this as a whole, so I'm only going to pick up minor details here, just for reference.
* K_dpm_2_a
   * THE FIGURE
      * Right:
         * The tail instantly sticks out. How it was created, or could be recreated, could be done in many ways. The material is like a plastic, melted lattice. While it doesn't connect, I think it would be possible that this is a Photoshop type filter effect, such as a bevel, using plastic, etc.  
         * [Provide references when you remember.]
            * Never be afraid to explore why something is created or how it was created. You may not be correct-and it's okay to not be correct, to be clear-because even in your fumbling, you might learn something. That is how great ideas come about, and the more you observe, the easier it will be to say, "Ah! I know how I can create that by doing x, z!"
         * Left: 
            * The pose is pretty cool here, with the paws being tucked a nice touch.
            * I actually really like the lighting. It did a pretty good job translating the lighting. I think SD does pretty good at translating sharp, contrasting lighting. I’ve noticed it with a lot of prompts. It’s also pretty good at “soft transitions,” which I often put as well.
            * The mouth…………………..
            * The fur seems to be more in painted, melted chunks instead of actual fur. It’s very smooth. Which, in general, we can tell that SD is very good at generating these fairly smooth transitions.
            * The eyes are actually okay here, and the detail is fine. We just have a little bit of an issue with the right eye, but overall it’s fine.     
               * Sometimes smaller, finer details can get lost with SD.     
   * THE BACKGROUND
      * The left
         * We do have, again, a perspective issue. Which, again, this all goes back to training, and how to fix issues when they crop up. But we’re not here at this exact second to discuss that. 
         * I do want to say I really like the overall aesthetic. It's surprisingly pleasing. The oval shapes and contrast really show the fundamentals of design quite well. 
            * Which means that we should really use things such as rhythm and harmony within our designs, same as we would as if we were creating things within the confines of graphical design. (That means things like: triangles and squares, in waves like the sea, complimentary colors, in the style of graphical design, rhythm, harmony)
      * The right
         * Is that California I spy? Or just the Western US? The sky looks like it's supposed to be smoke but it actually looks like stone. I guess it really IS a simulation, folks! There really is a ceiling and our universe is in some kind of Dyson sphere/mega structure. The Matrix is real!
   * GENERAL STYLE
      * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
         * Right:
            * This is more of a photo bashing sort of an idea. It has perspective, texture over painting, which I can assume is its way of making 2D+3D.
         * Left:
            * No.
      * Did it pick the right palette?
         * Not a chance!
* DDIM
   * THE FIGURE
      * LEFT
         * The figure here resembles more like a cat. It could resemble a dog, to be fair, but likely this image was from something of that nature. Through my training with Dreambooth, I’ve noticed that it’s done similar things while training, so I’m not really surprised.
         * Once again, though, the tail is disconnected from the rest of the body. We have to consider that there are so many mythical creatures, subsets, and amazing things that SD could/can learn and should/might learn/benefit from, since it has such a hard time when it does not have enough of a large stabilization point.
         * I absolutely love the colors–the pattern is right, even though the colors aren’t, which is kind of cool. And though the body is deformed, we have nubs on the shoulders to represent wings, and his hindpaws have been…amputated……turned…smooth, which gives it a natural look along with the fur. 
      * RIGHT
         * The right leg has also had the same treatment.
         * Like with the other samplers, if there’s an issue with one image, it seems to have it with both, which seems to be a fundamental problem with all creations, regardless of the sampler.
            * I’ve posted more information about this later in the document.
         * The angle, use of long and short fur, though, is a twist. To be honest, he looks more like a sheep, which, to be fair, isn’t all that bad.
         *    * THE BACKGROUND
      * LEFT
         * I feel like this is the art-student-in-me’s project, because while it doesn’t look realistic all that much, it’s creative. Like the other images, it doesn’t have a lot of depth, but you’ve got a focal point, and that’s something.
         * You can’t really tell what’s going on in some of the shadows.
         * There seems to be a screen door on the left, a quasi cave above with some kind of stone railing turned upside down, rocks on the right, alien blob on the left, Photoshop cave crystals in the back, some of that same filtering pattern on the right, etc. 
         * Let’s just ignore the fact the wolf goes through the fence. Reality.
      * RIGHT
         * I’d have to say that this is where SD shines on this one, because the placement of the objects, in terms of perspective, work really well. I think SD is very good when it comes to mathematical placements, even without the new CLIP updates. 
         * The shadow, too, and the deep contrast is what really brings this out.
            * On a sidenote, you can add keywords like:
               * Deep contrast
               * Harsh contrast
               * Sharp contrast
               * Soft contrast
               * Etc
            * To your work to get a wide variety of types of lighting that you can use just to see what HAPPENS. (Or you could just look up all the amazing tutorials people have made.)
   * GENERAL STYLE
      * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
         * Again, fairly good attempt. The right is better than the left, but not really; at least, not in the way I would imagine it. (I.e., my own work, things like Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmaron, or any of the cool things we have today.) 
      * Did it pick the right palette?
         * The left tried to get the pattern, at least. It tried. And the left tried to be like a sheep who stuck its hoof in an electrical socket.
         * How the red translated to the sky, which I think I said previously, but am not going to hunt for that statement, is good, at least. 
* K_lms
   * THE FIGURE
      * The left
         * The left, the left, everybody put the things you own in the box to the left! (If you can honestly name that reference, I will honestly generate something SFW for you for the first person that gets it LOL. But don’t cheat and Google it lmao. It’s NOT a major singer….)
         * This is actually one of my favorites. The moon, the atmosphere, and the Bloodborne vibe is just getting me. The palette is great.
         * Sadly, he only has one ear. 
         * Why is that tree floating, and why does it look like clip art in the background? Only spaghetti monsters will truly know.
         * The fur is still kind of jagged, just like the previous generation. He might actually look fluffy, but he might actually be like a porcupine. That said, you can actually see chunks of fur that are clumped together, and separate strands, which is all good data.
         * And just look at those paws. They aren’t even nightmares. They’re beautiful pupper paws that could do such beautiful tippytaps. (I like how Google didn’t recognize pupper, but had no problem with tippytaps. -_-)
      * The right
         * The colors are a lot more traditional, but the eyes certainly give off an eeric, blind feeling. 
            * EERIC. Who the HELL is Eeric!? 
            * Ladies and gents, fellows in space…I didn’t sleep much last night. But Eeric is now cannon. CANNON. Canon. 
            * Eeric Cannon. That’s his name now. Eeric Cannon. And he owns a ballistic cannon, wears purple and gold striped pants that are the equivalent of McHammer pants, but Victorian. 
         * His eyes have a very EERIE, REALISTIC feeling to them, which looks good, even though the pupils have noped out. 
         * While his legs turn into sticks that look like they would break, the chest fur looks really great. 
         * Symmetry, too, is pretty apparent, though not perfect, and it’s something that SD, or AI in general, perhaps, seems to be fond of.
         * Although…I’m sorry to say that….either this wolf-man is half bush or half a ball of yarn. Because after that fence, I’m not sure what he is. 
            * And that’s something that I have noticed with training, is that SD will get…half of something right, but not the whole picture, which is why training from so many angles is essential for the whole piece. 
   * THE BACKGROUND
      * Comparatively speaking, notice that the character here has a realistic precedence, whereas DDIM focused more on a realistic background, and more of a cartoony character. 
      * Both foregrounds are pretty realistic here, with both backgrounds actually taking a backseat and becoming less realistic. 
         * This becomes apparent when you sit down and study the different samplers and how they are interpreting the data. 
      * I really like the gradient on the right, even though there isn’t a whole lot of depth. 
         * I also like the little bits of light on the bottom, even though they don’t make sense.
   * GENERAL STYLE
      * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
         * DO YOU EVEN—lol, no.
      * Did it pick the right palette?
         * Though it didn’t pick up the palette in the way one would hope, it did pick up the colors from the left. It incorporated them into the image, so that’s something.
* K_huen
   * THE FIGURE
      * The LEFT
         * I like how the leg is just up there, detached. Detachablehips dot org, a foundation for wolves with no thighs. It would totally work if he didn’t have a city for a butt.
            * Also, it’s almost like his tail is his second hip/knee.
         * I really like the style in general here. I don’t know what…well, who, they referenced, but the style is really nice. 
         * It looks like he stuck his paws in a can of paint. Or………murdling happened. Mid-air murdling.
            * (Which is really why I’m working on training my own data to help work with these kinds of things. Which, hopefully, will help.)
         * Otherwise, the form is really good; it just looks great.
      * The Right
         * This boy has some tude. It got the color, the face is mean, which I actually see SD do a lot. In a great deal of the animal expressions I have come across, they tend to be quite grumpy. :< The little reflection of the light from the eye is great.
         * The turn of the fur around the body, too, is also pretty great. (Again, SD is a great way for others to potentially learn about art—well, not potentially, lol, can.)
         * The stomach turning into some plastic looking thing I’m not too sure about, nor do I wish to know, but the fact he has no legs….well. I’m sure he’s still a good boi. At least he still has a tail, ig.
         * I also like that look of color dodge/color burn that we have, which gives it a sort of smoked look. 
   * THE BACKGROUND
      * The left looks like it was a bit of a city paintover. I really don’t think that SD understands what we want, if only because it doesn’t understand the keywords in the sense of there’s nothing for it to reference. I’m sure that if I used different words, that some of this might have been adjusted. I’ve seen it do some really good things that do look like a good blend of 2D/3D, but it’s under very specific circumstances.
         * But this really just look like it took a city and went -SLAP!- here’s some grain.
      * The right background feels a lot more traditional to me–more based on a photo and traditional usage of photography/composition/rule of thirds, etc. 
         * That’s something I really like about k_huen is that it seems to be a good blend of that randomization but also very good at picking up that realism at the same time.
         * Overall, the right just feels pretty solid.
   * GENERAL STYLE
      * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
         * NAH BRAH.
      * Did it pick the right palette?
         * For the left, I think that it really did a pretty good job at getting the colors or style/pattern pretty good in general. It got the theme, which makes it so we’re not hedging into copyright destroying territory, should that be an issue if you’re using img2img, etc. 
* K_euler
   * THE FIGURE
      * The LEFT
         * I feel so sad for the child on the left, THAT CLEARLY NEEDS A HUG. Chibi child, don’t worry! I will hug you! -hug- 
         * I like that it kept the theme the same throughout, including low poly cone trees in the back.
         * I feel like the tail is a wood texture, ngl.
      * The Right
         * I swear this kid is on a friggin ship in the sky, and that Ronald McDonald’s ghost has possessed his mouth. It’s almost like it interpreted the bottom half as a furry, or a fursuiter, but then it just went “Yah, the rest of you is a wolf, but inside your mouth, you’re really a head in a mascot costume!” 
            * Also, his feet look more like dinosaur claws…not that I don’t approve of him, and his tail, but he’s def a stitched-together monster.
   * THE BACKGROUND
      * I don’t have too much to say about the left, other than the style is consistent.
      * The right is pretty creative, and the usage of such interesting shapes really lifts the entire piece. The Escher railing kind of tricks my mind, though!
   * GENERAL STYLE
      * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
         * The background actually looks pretty 3D for the left one. For a try, I mean, that’s pretty dang good.
      * Did it pick the right palette?
         * The right did something right.
         * And yes, again, if you want the palette to actually be better, you can make it better by adding palette at the end with the words, using img2img, inpainting/outpainting, etc. There are a dozen ways to change it, and no particular right one.
* K_euler_a
   * THE FIGURE
      * The LEFT
         * One of my favorites by far, especially for its creativity, especially for fantasy, I almost always love what it pops out. 
            * That said, I’ve noticed that SD, in general, has a hard time attaching tails, which I believe I mentioned above. And this is, again, something I am working on training with, to try to alleviate some of these issues, since SD just seems to have a fundamental problem with this, and often seems to think that it’s some kind of clothing, I guess. More often than not that is usually what it tries to generate.
            * Another issue is generating mouths within mouths. Again, I’m not really sure why this is an issue, and you’d have to ask someone who is far more knowledgeable than me as to why this, in particular, happens. 
         * I absolutely love the stance here, and it’s actually pretty good for a puppy/human/tiny hooman stance. Besides the tail disconnect, it’s really pretty good. 
      * The Right
         * I love the sand, and the whole theme here. The geometric crystals that it added to the back are pretty schweet. 
            * Really, if you want variance, pick k_euler_a for fantasy stuff. There’s also k_dpm_2 (and 2_a), too, and sometimes DDIM or huen can be good. But generally speaking, I love euler and euler a for just trying to make some very unique images. It’s really great for img2img especially. 
            * A great example of this would be taking things like Lisa Frank dogs and use img2img, along with various key words (especially if you combine them with master painters, or whatever kind of painter that has a really good style that matches well with whatever you’re trying to match with) and you can wind up with something like this very easily:  
   * While he is huge, and at least has a pattern, he has that green WoW glow–something that I have also come across in conflict with training. (Again, some things may override, conflict with what you are trying to create, and moving your terminology, reiteration, etc, can help.)
   * Another thing here, of course, is that the character is just far too big. Naturally, we can use inpainting to resolve this, to some degree, but inpainting is also just as questionable as anything else, to be fair.
   * However, we can also solve this by using base methodology, which is something I go into depth about in other places by using keywords/general prompting to achieve.
   * Lastly, that orange with the blue eye–mm! Perfection! Beautifully done.
   * THE BACKGROUND
   * The way that the light spreads across the wooden floor is just so well captured. SD always amazes me with its ability to capture things. As well as making me want to….end it…give it a strong talking to when it doesn’t…
   * Cityscapes are something that SD has a significant amount of data on, from what I can see. There’s so many good cities, with various styles from drawings in all kinds of mediums, 3D cities, and photos, etc.
   * GENERAL STYLE
   * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
   * Not a bad attempt, but still not close.
   * Did it pick the right palette?
   * At least it’s gray and white?
   * territory, should that be an issue if you’re using img2img, etc. 
   * K_dpm_2
   * THE FIGURE
   * The LEFT
   * Whoah! There is some sass in that pose! There is movement in that spine. 
   * Which, if you aren’t an artist, one thing that you should keep in mind when creating poses is that poses should convey movement. Or, rather, there is a flow to the body and a direction with each pose, which we discussed much earlier in this document. (It’s actually also in the art history section of the document as well.) 
   * Imagine your spine as a line with an arrow at each end. There’s one arrow at the top at your head, and one arrow at the end where your pelvis is. So, you’ve got two points. This line is your center point–your balance–and each time you bend and move, this line bends and moves with you. 
   * Now, this line can just extend straight though the center of the body and it’s called the action line/line of action. It basically gives you an idea of how the body is moving.
   * For the wolf, here is a very quick line of action, drawn with my mouse:   
   * As you can see, this line bends, showing how the body moves. This dynamic motion, even while stationary, makes the subject far more interesting and life-like. You can see some more professional examples here. 
      * This line helps you to create more realistic poses, even if the figure is standing or sitting, it conveys a sense of weight, gravity, etc. Even though we are creating art by generating it, that doesn’t mean the rules of art suddenly go out the window. The guy who tried to literally swerve into me and kill me today can, though.
      * This also makes it easier to animate in traditional (or digital) animation because it helps you remember where the pose is going and following through. Think of it like what happens when you throw or drop something–how it leaves and feels your hand, and how the motion doesn’t quite stop even after you’ve dropped something–there’s deceleration, etc. 
      * All aspects of real life are/can be incorporated into art. 
      * So when something looks bad, or off, and you can’t quite understand why, look to nature, to real life, or other artists, to help you understand why your prompt isn’t going so well, and what you can do to fix it.
      * The paws over the railing look really cool.
      * Otherwise, I really love the pose, and the leg going through the pillars.
      * The Right
      * It looks more like a spiky rat and a merchant. 
      * The mouth looks like it’s either open, closed, or there’s two sets of teeth, again. 
      * THE BACKGROUND
      * The wolf dividing the colors is cool but also distracting. 
      * The detailed, realistic background is enjoyable to look at, and I don’t have a whole lot to say other than that.
      * The right reminds me of Star Wars.
      * The reflections of light on the metal are pretty sweet. 
      * GENERAL STYLE
      * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
      * The right is just better with all those shapes. I really enjoy looking at it, to be perfectly honest. It’s very inviting. 
      * Did it pick the right palette?
      * About the same as the others.
      * k_dpm_2_a
      * THE FIGURE
      * The LEFT
      * Once again, the broken hips exist. His hips are also city hips. Donate your hips and turn them into cities, now a function of SD!
      * It picked up the light behind the finger, like translucency in skin. The paw is actually pretty well done. 
      * I LOVE the symmetry and the 3d aspect of the thigh…shin…whatever it is. City legs. Feet.
      * The usage of hard, pointed shapes here actually really goes with the whole angry vibe. There is something called shape language, which is the fine art of using hard or soft edges to communicate something within a design. 
      * Here are some great examples for you to look at.
      * This applies to any character, regardless of realism. This can translate to outfit, hair design, makeup choices, etc. So if you want to create angry characters, consider using the language of shapes to up your game.
      * Again, the face, from the front, just looks good. So many faces from the front look great. Which gives me all the more reason to keep training weird angles…
      * The Right
      * The hips are a little less broken. I’m impressed. However, he has no arms. I guess it works out. Again, he has that fantasy/slashed over the eye look.
      * THE BACKGROUND
      * Again, the shadows aren’t accurate. 
      * That’s a very interesting problem to really address. Sometimes it’s really, really beautiful and uncannily accurate. Other times it just doesn’t gaf.
      * I love the background on the left. It looks very peaceful–the warm yellows/greens are actually pretty complimentary.
      * Also, it almost looks like the skies are connected.
      * GENERAL STYLE
      * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
      * About the same as previous ones.
      * Did it pick the right palette?
      * Left, pattern–awesome.
      * Right, nice colors, but not completely.
      * DDIM
      * THE FIGURE
      * The LEFT
      * The chibi/small pup! Again! Cute! But what is with that creepy statue on the left? I am flummoxed! AHHHHHHH!
      * I feel like it tried to make it a cabin in the woods.
      * The wood figures are really neat. I’ve actually played with wooden figures in SD and they’ve come out incredibly well, so if you ever have the time, I suggest trying it!
      * Sadly, it has the snout of a pig more than a wolf………...
      * The Right
      * Occasionally it will spit out a full feral body, and I love this result. It’s funny how the legs are more human, and the front are wolf—the same problem that persists throughout.
      * The proportions are also off–the legs being a little too long–not that this can’t be adjusted afterward, etc, and it’s kind of cool looking–but at least the face looks great.
      * Two toes, four toes, three toes?
      * THE BACKGROUND
      * Pretty cozy, but also not cohesive due to the fact that THERE’S A ROOF ON THE INSIDE..OR…OUTSIDEINSIDE????????????
      * For the right, again, the perspectives just. don’t. match. The figures simply don’t go with the rest of the background. At least it’s trying. 
      * GENERAL STYLE
      * Was it able to merge 3D/2D?
      * -_-
      * Did it pick the right palette?
      * -sigh-


        For a moment, let’s say that we really like these results, in general. (Which is great, because hey, you might like what you create, even if it’s not what you wanted!)
        I’ve actually gone through and created a bunch of wolves, to be honest, to see what SD was doing with fur/wolves/animals in general. I’m actually going to include this information down below in the “My Fine Tuning/Textual Inversion Escapade.”
        


      * WERE THERE REPETITIONS?
      * Without more data, some of this may be difficult to say. It's clear that the way hair, and other small strands of like material, are applied in different ways. We can see that sometimes SD will:
      * wrap around the form-SD is fully capable of acting upon the idea of putting fur on a 3D sphere, if you will. This means you should be confident and creative when approaching these kinds of projects.
      * just randomly pick a direction, as if you were looking at a piece of faux-fur
      * use a blend of the two
      * or do something stylized, etc
      * We've seen this in this study, as well as the ones above, which is building our understanding of SD and how it interprets data.
      * We can observe SD's capabilities of picking up lights color, shadow, etc, but we also see gaps in knowledge that could be adjusted with more time.
      * This can be both a blessing and a curse, just like any kind of creation.
      * Poses are often re-used, regardless of the sampler.
      * Sometimes, the only way to know might simply be to just make a bunch of sitting pictures, etc, of said object. It's a lengthy task, to be sure, but it might be useful in exploring.
      * It consistently tried to give them hands instead of paws, regardless of sampler, and also tried to change the hind legs into thighs. However, it wasn't able to fully complete the task, some ended up with a lot of very strange wolves with oddities.
      * WHY IS THIS DATA IMPORTANT?
      * Because it tells us what the sampler may or may not influence, how minute the details, or how large the influence might be.
      * This differentiates between SD's base functions and what is, and isn't because of a sampler, etc.
      * WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THIS INFO?
      * And that's the biggest question. What's the point of doing samplers? Are we doing more than simply observing art and commenting on its capabilities? The best answer is simply, "We can."
      * EXAMPLE 1:
      * For example, let's say that we have a grayscale scene that we have made in Blender. Or we've made a grayscale 3D scene using SD like this or this. (Either is fine.) 
      * To note, these are all from just the grayscale image (the first one.)
      * We can then take that image an adjust it in a wide variety of ways, changing its color using img2img (not going for exact):  
      * Adding texture overlays [3d scene, wood texture]:  
      * [3d scene, wood texture, blue yellow orange palette]:  
      * You can then start adding objects to the scene, such as “3d scene, wood texture, blue yellow orange palette, 3d water plane”: 
      *         * 3d scene, wood texture, blue yellow orange palette, 3d ocean plane with waves
      *         * 3d scene, wood texture, blue yellow orange palette, 3d ocean plane with waves, fish, beach balls, towels, seagulls
      *         * These were all done with k_lms. 
         * Naturally, you don’t have to do things this way, but you can.There are always ways to iterate if you are having trouble getting specific placements of objects, etc. 
         * You also don’t have to iterate—you can just put in things like “3d scene, sand and seashell texture” and it can just do:   
         * And it’s just going to do what it’s going to do because it already knows what seamless textures are. Saying “3d scene, sand and seashell overlay” isn’t too different:   
         * Using the secondary picture (the one with the balls), and the same sentence with overlay:   
         * Vs “3d scene, sand and seashell texture”:   
         * These become 3D objects instead, which may or may not be your aim. 
            * I can iterate to make it better. (I think the quality of the first shows that iteration tends to make it better. However, that doesn’t mean you have to.)
            * Then I can start throwing in keywords. I can put in “3d scene, sand and seashell texture overlay, various sizes, scattered sizes”:   
               * Then, just using images from the past batch+random loopback…From 1, 2, 3….etc. You can also just adjust it with color correction, for an easier time, if you’re using a UI that supports it:
               *                  * And, after about a gazillion iterations, and a lot of going back and forth…….iloveseashellsimogfromcaliforniadontjudgeme…  
               * Which was part of this batch:   
               * Lastly, you can put grayscale to color, say specific parts of the image are colored, just so you know. (I figured this out with the Dreambot, and it still holds true.)
               * Some fun mentionables along the way:    
               * And how I also gradually shifted the perspective (through key words, and some iteration, something that is discussed in my prompting guides):
               *      
               *                  *                  *                  * Then we can laugh as the perspective changed, which is probably my own fault for picking what I liked the most, HAHAHAHA! I get what I dang well deserve.
               *                  *                  * And that’s what eventually led to the pink shells above right after.
               * I’ve accomplished this using no artists, no references to render engines, nothing other than using a few keywords and my base image. 
                  * EXAMPLE 2:
                  * When I saw the tail for the first K_dpm_2_a, I realized that the data could also be 3D pen art. So, I wrote:
                  * wolf standing on a cliff made of 3D metallic lattice, detailed, art style 3D pen and professional photography
                  * And it popped out these results:
                  * Wolf One
                  * Wolf Two
                  * Wolf Three
                  * While it is not exact, and there are various types of results, I think it's pretty similar. I made some pretty wicked designs with it.
                  * So, just remember that there’s probably some underlying data or something that you can learn from each image that you are looking at, even if it’s not the image you wanted to create.


CONCLUSION


Overall, I would really have to say that the sampler does matter a lot. Img2img is a GREAT tool, and SD has the capability to smoothly and seamlessly carry on.
Can you always know what sampler to choose? 
Well, I think that depends on your preferences, how much experience you have, and also, perhaps, what you’re willing to accept as “acceptable.” 
Can you determine some base values to use?
I think the answer is yes.
Now, of course, yes, I want to point out that you can combine 2D and 3D with stable Diffusion. So, I decided to do some goofing off with the prompt matrix and, here you go:




furry anthro wolf character with red dragon wings, black hair, glasses, sitting on a bench, lazy afternoon, in the style of romanticism, disney, anime, bna, final fantasy


  
  

Samplers are K_Ims and K_euler_a, both first generation, also 1 more version




3d, an old cottage, in the middle of a fjord, fantasy, night, in the art style of unreal engine, octane render, cinematic lighting, mid shot


  





I made various matrixes, but one of the last was:


furry anthro wolf character with red dragon wings, black hair, glasses, sitting on a bench, lazy afternoon, realism, in the art style of romanticism, disney,  bna, final fantasy | 3d, an old cottage, in the middle of a fjord, fantasy, night, in the art style of unreal engine, octane render, cinematic lighting, mid shot, 3d background | 3D forest, unreal engine, soft transitions, realistic, glowing orbs Steps: 77, Sampler: k_lms, CFG scale: 13.5, Seed: 386213926, GFPGAN, Prompt Matrix Mode


  
  

  





One thing I really found kind of funny is that through the images, and SD in general, is that you, over time, will see themes. Generate enough images, especially with the same seeds or keywords, and you’ll start noticing patterns. And these patterns can be seen even as you change the samplers. You can see the small changes as they progress and iterate–it’s kind of fun, tbh, to watch/observe.
        And, as a sidenote, sorry to anyone reading and feeling burned out from any repetition—haha! Unfortunately, since this is something I am doing live with so many people, over time, it’s just hard to keep track of what I’m saying, and I have no idea what sections of the document people are reading, need help with, etc. So, it’s a mite difficult to even know if I need to stress one thing or another. So, my apologies for that!
        Let us return to our thief in blue.

*4 - A THIEF OF ITS OWN


Just for one second, I want to mention something. One thing I have noticed, especially when it comes to if you're uploading an image for SD to pull from, is that there is a big difference between putting in an artist's name as a keyword vs putting in their name as "art style of." (Putting their name can produce some very odd results, at times, often distorting the image, or making it too similar to the original image.)
If you want a lot of variance, you can simply use their name as a keyword and use a medium, such as oil painting and photography, and it will give you a wider scope of images to work with. 
Since we mostly used img2img in our last study, it was important, I felt, to give SD a chance to whip out some cleverly bearded men of its own. After all, I've only been half-purloining by using a reference image.
For cohesion, I have chosen not to include an artist, and will be using the ever-so-lovely phrase I coined above. Maestro, begin!


portrait of an old thief in a blue hood with a gray beard, in a dark forest at night, realistic, digital oil painting
  



As you can see, this time, we are also using the ever-fantastic GFPGAN.
One of the things that you first notice is the similarities between this study and the previous one. Many of the faces we saw in the previous iterations are here.
Now we can say, naturally, well, those are the same words, OF COURSE we are going to have similarities and that would be true. 
(These were all at 50 steps, 7.5 guidance, because I like cohesion.) 
Instead of providing my own personal opinion this time….(except PLMS’s SHINY barrel man and huen’s friggin’ Blue Beard-esque fellows)..cuz ya’ll have your own eyeballs…I shall, instead, give an overview and my thoughts on not using img2img, using img2img, and how SD really likes symmetrical front view faces.

*5 - A PHOTO WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS


—---------- —------ —----------- —--------- —--  —---------- —------ —----------- —---------- —------ —----------- —---------- —------ —-----------
  Photograph by me from Wuhan, China, September 6th, 2004
The irony does not escape me that I started working on this on the exact date 18 years later.


One of the most interesting aspects that I learned about this part of the study is just how you can tell what a sampler is good at, and what it isn’t good at. And that’s the funny part, because it also shows what SD is good at, and also what it isn’t good at when you do things a certain way. Over the course of time, we expect SD to improve, and yes, I could improve the prompt itself. However, for the sake of actually telling what the samplers are genuinely doing, I wanted to make sure that my prompt was as accurate as possible. This meant that I did NOT try to do anything to make the figure better by citing any particular artists, etc. 
The first thing I really noticed here is that, across the board, is that the samplers were actually better at picking up the landscape over the figure. This makes complete sense, given the fact that there’s just no way that there’s not a significant amount of data with landscapes. 
Some of the landscapes were much more realistic while others were more cartoonish. What was really interesting was how the samplers treated this sculpture, which I’d like to add is absolutely HUGE. This is NOT small, just to be clear–I’m sure you can tell by the gate. 
I began by using a base study. This was just to make sure that we had some kind of base, because with all studies, you know, make sure all of your ducks are in a row before you get started.
But first, I must present to you the grandest of the grand, churro arm mermaid making a floating mountain in the sky. Nevermind what's on her tail--check out of three arms like she took a panorama and *moved.* She has an arm coming out of her FACE, which is really orange cheesy seaweed. Also, not to fin-shame, but her tail looks like it's in a sausage casing.

*6 -A FANCY ANIMAL


  

Photograph by me from Wuhan, China, September 6th, 2004




As we summarized with our last study, the absolute sheer number of training on landscapes and photography is absolutely apparent. There’s no question, because as soon as I started working on the image, it started deviating from the original.
I only used the phrase, “Swan swimming in dirty brown water, animal photography.” 
Not only did I get this view from the front, but I instantly got views from all different sides, which shows just how important it is to remember your subject, even when it comes to samplers. How well it will perform isn’t just about the filter itself. It will do the best that it can do, and that’s what it’s going to do.
If it doesn’t really know what you’re trying to create, or it doesn’t have a whole lot of data on the subject, it will do the best that it can do. 
For this study, I always set the seed to 1, just to be clear so that everyone knows what to expect.

—---------- —------ —----------- —--------- —--  —---------- —------ —----------- —---------- —------ —----------- —---------- —------ —----------- —-____ —___________—--------// —----_—-----------______ —---- _________— —- —- _________—-- —- ___________—-// —-------- - – - - - - - –//  —----------- —--------- —--  —---------- —------ —------ —- —--------- —---------------- ____________ - – - — —-----
What was interesting about this study is that it was apparent that, regardless of the sampler, that there were fundamental flaws within the training, which is something I have been studying with the next text, “A Surprising Problem.” 
Frankly, this is to be expected, given the age of Stability, and I want to be clear that I, in no way, would want to throw shade at the devs in any way. 


~~~~~~


This study isn’t just about photos, though–far from it, as I’m sure you’ve gathered from my first test. 
For the next part of the test, I used the same phrase of “Swan swimming in dirty brown water, animal photography.” 
I wanted to ask the following questions:


                  1. How close would these images be to the ones using img2img?
                  2. How much would these images be influenced by the samplers, compared to img2img?


[image1]
[image 2]


Like the previous study, I chose to first go with using the 1st seed, and, as predicted, the results are similar to ones we have already experienced. Let’s go ahead and break down each section, bullet point by bullet point, so that we can have a better understanding of how these samplers work.




                  * —---
                  * —----
        
Since I don’t want to completely focus on img2img, I went ahead and rolled the dice with see how SD handled swans.


Swan swimming in dirty brown water, animal photography; it’s in columns this time
  





        Finally, I went with a random seed, because it’s not just about the subtleties, or repeatedly showing the same data to be the case, further enforcing what styles are best for each sampler. And, there are all types of styles, types of things to create, and I’d like to include as much data as possible. (In this particular case, we are studying photography/animals.)
        And here are the images that came from that:

                  * WHAT'S CONSISTENT?
                  * As we go through the samplers, we want to build an overall, fundamental picture of SD. We want to daisy chain and connect that knowledge together. From what I see, there are consistent changes in hue/value/saturation, and adherence/prompt interpretation.

*7 - ANIMALS AND OILS


Nothing would be accurate or complete without testing something beyond img2img. It’s really great that we have inpainting, outpainting, masking, and all kinds of interesting things we can do with textural inversion and fine-tuning, but we should always be pushing the limits of what we can do, and try to understand the platform that we just so happen to be standing on.
        Enter the zebra party! (Zebra, realistic, oil painting.)


Please click the image to see the larger version.
  



        My first objective was, realistically, just to see what was in the database. As one of my art professors said, “Understand the rules so you can break ‘em.” (Although, I suppose we can break them ANYWAY…)
        I used just square images; images that are longer in length tend to have a better result in terms of not cutting off the subject. (Portraits/tall people work on height, in my personal experience.)
        By using a square image, I expected, for the most part, to get headshots/portraits, because this is the typical response for SD.
        To begin, I think we see a general trend of it trying to use normal colors to emulate training data.

                  * -


        My second set of images, though, I decided it was time to get wild! I wanted to know how the zebra would look if I threw in something unrealistic. And this is actually how I’ve worked with several oil paintings in regards to animals. Most of the time SD does pretty well if I say something ridiculous, especially if it is more well-known. I can just say a bunch of random crap, like….

I put “zebra on a rainbow, realistic, oil painting.”

Yes, you can say that horses are, indeed, far more familiar with inner tubes and such devices.
Naturally, we can prompt around these–but that isn’t the point.

*8 - A VAST LANDSCAPE


As I mentioned in “No Name, No Shame,” 


The importance of SIZE. As some of you know, and as I’ve mentioned in other sections of this document, the size of your document matters.
I chose NOT to add TEXTLESS, because I wanted a true representation of what each sampler would do. 
For the first set of images, I put in “a vast landscape.”

*9 -A SURPRISING PROBLEM


I kept hearing the words: craiyon/[insert x, y, z] is better at anime.
After weeks of hearing this, and having done plenty of things on craiyon, I decided I would put it to the test.
Were they right? Well...sort of. Yes, but actually no. (Especially with all the improvements, inpainting, img2img, etc.)
I took some time to go study the old prompts on dreambot/godot to see what people made besides myself. It wasn't too long before I realized some of the actual problem--and it is/was a simple fix.
I started with simply replicating  some of people's prompts just to see how it would be interpreting things.
—---------- —------ —----------- —-------------------- —--------- —--  —---------- —------ —------ —- —--------- —---------------- ____________ - – - — —-----
—---------- —------ —----------- —--------- —--  —---------- —------ —----------- —---------- —------ —----------- 
This study is actually more than just a look at samplers, but also the degradation of prompts, and how to avoid, when creating general prompts, things going wrong, ESPECIALLY PEOPLE, and how to resolve:


                  * Similar faces over time.
                  * Repeated poses.
                  * Jelly bodies.
                  * Unnatural faces. etc.


I will be using k_euler_a only for this portion of the study to prove a point! (It just makes it easier because of the way I have set it up.
This solution does not rely on just the dataset, per se, but more on being able to wordsmith, and use all the information that I’ve already covered in this document, along with the information that we’ve learned about samplers here. I know it’s something a lot of people have been frustrated about, and while it’s easy enough to use an artist, I think that being able to learn how to actually get around the issue without it is actually valuable to learn.

I just want to note that symmetry can be a double edged sword. It can make your people look really good, but it can also make them look…….well….as you can see…nope. This works better at various angles, such as the more difficult 3/4ths view. 


This process takes more effort, of course, but it means that your prompts are going to be more unique than just putting in an artist’s name.
By now, though, you have something incredibly unique, you can put in whatever colors, additions, whatever you like, and you’ve gone through the effort of learning so that you know how to make adjustments so that, in the future, you know how to work around things when they get really difficult.
With our results in hand here, let’s take and add a few more final adjustments so that we can take our four base images here, with this prompt:


—-------




        Now, let’s go ahead and run that through, and now that we actually have our faces, it’s important that we take our time and now decide on a pose, as well as mitigating any type of word problems, maybe even switch around some of our words to add more flare, and just get a general idea for some more spice. For my particular design, I’m going with…

Vs


—
(I had to add a dress, because all too often, you know, n00ds.)


  
  







You can ditch your commas, you can delete things you don’t like, you can add repetition, you can choose to go, “Hey, that’s a little too wordy for me! Yup!”
        But this is about adding words, not chopping them down like Babe and his blue ox, alright? I’m here to be verbose this time! (As…if…this document…isn’t that?)
        Now, there’s two key things I want to point out:


                  * Your pose:
                  * Your pose should fit your ratio.
                  * Use height and width for tall full bodies.
                  * Use length and width for landscapes, etc.
                  * Use squares for portraits, too.
                  * If you’re going to do something that’s a portrait, then if you say things like sitting on a tree, yeah, it’s more likely to do a shot where you’ll see the full body. 
                  * If you want to see something full body, too 
                  * If you’re doing generic keywords:
                  * That doesn’t mean you need an artist.
                  * Rather, in this case, since we’re talking about anime, we can use things like shonen, shojo, etc, to make our prompt much different. 
                  * You can also use things like colored pencil, thick lines, etc. Whatever you can think of, you can use it.


        As I have mentioned, though, it isn’t fair to simply use k_euler_a, because that’s not an accurate representation of everything, and I think I’ve shown that you can make some AMAZING anime images (which I know ya’ll haven’t seen yet lol) with some effort, but once we start changing the samplers, we can actually see that we’re making major differences, as opposed to simply minor ones.

*10- THE REALITY OF COLOR


This goes over various traditional art styles and how they are impacted by the samplers.


We’ve talked a lot about SD being only as good as its dataset. I know a lot of people have been frustrated by “it’s not in there.”
Well, the truth is this: it’s not just about what is in the dataset or what isn’t–it’s about learning to build on keywords–but sometimes, there are just better options. 
One of the things I noticed during my LSP prompting was that poodles had a super good dataset, and everything looked great. 
        So, in this part, I wanted to highlight the following:


                  * Colored pencils
                  * The quality of datasets
                  * Using keywords vs an artist
                  * And how samplers change all of these


        In looking at these images, one of the first things I’d like you’d to notice is the consistency of the colored pencil itself. 
        Colored pencil is one of my many beloved mediums………..

For now, I’m just going to put the images together, and then I’ll sort them accordingly when I’m ready. Then, I’ll explain my aim, blahblahblah.

a woman sitting on a windowsill next to hanging garden plants, colored pencil, realistic, soft lighting, warm spring sketch, detailed


  





        To start, I want to go over some general conclusions, though fairly obvious, just to get them out of the way:


                  * The color palettes are relatively similar throughout.
                  * Some samplers are better than others.
                  * Data matters.
                  * No, I didn’t use an artist.


        I don’t really want to write this section yet, because of some of the other sections that come before it and I don’t want to repeat information, so I’m just going to leave it here for now, with this……..obviously repeated information, BAHAHAHAHA. :)

These next two directly deal with changing techniques, as opposed to using artists as the foundation, to be clear. The point of this is to show how you, again, don’t always have to use an artist, but also, consistency, inconsistencies, abilities, techniques, yadda yadda, you’ll hear my yakkity yak when I get there.

*OVERALL CONCLUSIONS


Please understand that these conclusions are a work in progress, and, as such, may be inaccurate. I could be totally friggin wrong! So, don't take it as what I think as the gospel truth, yah? 


GENERAL TIPS & PRACTICES


                  * If you are having trouble understanding which sampler to choose, set your sampler to 50, cfg/guidance at 7.5. Then run through and do, say, 12 images of your prompt to get a good idea of what each sampler looks like, the amount of variance (not the setting) that you’re getting with your images.
                  * If you’re still having trouble, I suggest that you actually look at your subject matter. Yes, look into the data. There might be an issue with it, or something that could be tweaked, or your prompting just needs to be better, etc. You can do this by taking your subject, such as “dog,” and looking at it at various sizes, by generating something like 30 images as photos, drawings, etc. This gives you a better idea of what’s there to look at.
                  * You can also look at things like LAION’s database, etc, along with images for whatever models you might be using to get a better idea of what you’re looking at.
                  * Steps:
                  * I always test steps at 50 as a base.
                  * Start with low steps and gradually increase. Then, change the guidance/cfg, and increase the steps to test and see for yourself.
                  * Each sampler does do better at certain steps, but choosing the steps is different according to the model/subject/sampler.
                  * Each sampler kind of has its own taste, but certain ones will brighten your palette through color/lighting/saturation/coolness or warmth in color, etc.
                  * Some samplers appear to be a mix of techniques while others seem to have a narrowed focus. 


THE SAMPLERS, SPECIFICALLY


                  * PLMS
                  * Requires a lot more work, sometimes generations, and clarity, but also is really good at getting those little details.
                  * DDIM
                  * Tends to be really realistic. I think the best way to describe it would be that it likes to find all of the tones within an object. Let’s say you have a picture with three colors in it-red, white, and blue. Then take DDIM, and have it turn it into a gradient…now you have red, pink, white, light blue, and blue.

                  * So far, in my personal observation, this is one of the best ones for fantasy. The sweet spot seems to be around 30 steps, and around 7.5 guidance, and this is regardless of img2img, or if you’re just using prompts in general. This also can lead to a soft but detailed look.

*MY FINE TUNING/TEXTUAL INVERSION ESCAPADE, PART 1:


        As a moron, it’s only fair to let you know that I probably only understand this because I’m like a bull in a china shop—and I’ve learned by whapping everything from every possible angle. Furthermore, there’s still a great deal that I am learning, and a great deal of ground that has been covered by other people that I haven’t even bothered reading. 
        Before we begin, though, I want to add some links here for those who are interested in actually learning about these subjects.

                  * Library of Concepts
        
MY APPROACH:


As a quick precursor, if you don’t know what they are, textual inversion and fine tuning are two different ways to adjust SD’s dataset(s.) The way that you go about creating images, in some sense, in terms of quality, etc, are similar. 
Textual inversion is just taking the information SD already has, but fine tuning is training ALL of SD.
It’s like painting one block vs painting 20 blocks. 
If you want to see textual inversion real time for free, you can load one of my concepts here, and type one of the above phrases to see it for yourself. (I do have things from DB but I am not publicly sharing them rn.)
This allows us to really take advantage of things that we want to create by using images that we might have, including shoving our own faces into SD and putting them on other people. But that’s not the only thing we can do.
If some of you know who I am, I like creating a lot of weird creature designs from bizarre bilby/polar bear/river of Styx monsters to colorful dessert-based animals for fun. Though I’m mostly a furry artist, studying characters and drawing concepts/designs has always been a passion of mine. So, when SD came out, I started creating animals. I’d been spending the past year using the Dream/Wombo app on Android trying to create bizarre designs. Which I was then turning into actual designs every once in a while. (I’d be happy to do a tutorial if people are interested in the subject.) 
As I was creating, I started realizing very quickly that you could really bullshit SD pretty hardcore. 
It began with me trying to combine animals with ice cream. Some of them were horrifying yet melty, to be sure, but eventually I started hitting on the correct terminology. Things started looking pretty good. Then I decided I was combining ice cream and poodles:


  

  



        I had this moment where I was like, wow, hey, they look like cotton candy, I wonder if…? And I had already suspected/knew it was all down to the datasets–how could it not be, right? 
        So, I kept following the road down. And then I got to doing cherry ice cream and poodles, and this came out:


  

  



        And I knew in that second that my theories were correct, and that I could absolutely swap anything in SD.
        In other words, I knew that if something was already in the dataset–say, a poodle–that I could use that information to my advantage for training, that I could use it as a base, etc, for anything I created.
        A lot of people have been training SD using their own faces, including myself: 


  
  
  



        And frankly, one of the best first tips is: make sure your reference images are good. (But more on that later!)
        Since it isn’t easy, though, a common tactic is to use something like a celebrity that SD already has training on and slap whatever you’re trying to train (fine tuning) and combine it with it. This is a good way to “cheat the system” for your own personal use, but the problem with it in general is that you don’t want to end up relying on it because it can overwrite the original training. (But that’s SD’s problem, not yours, so cheat away—just keep it in mind.)
        However, that said, we can use this knowledge to our advantage. Not just with prompting, or with textual inversion, or celebrity heads…but with all of SD. :P In other words, like I mentioned with the poodle….You can cheat with animals, too! Woooooooooo! -Runs around like a ninny with her hands in the air-
        Even so, before embarking on such a journey, there’s a few really important things I’d like to point out that I have found out in my research. As far as I can tell, and not that I’ve been watching chat like a hawk, so someone could have said something, for all I know–but there’s much more to it than just picking a celebrity. And hey, if there’s more information on this, and someone has worked on it, please feel free to let me know, because this community has been moving really fast, haha!
        Anyway, I’ve been working on training several different things, but I’m going to keep some of those cards to myself for now. What I will say, however, is that I’ve been using…poodles. (Well, not just poodles, actually, more than poodles, to be fair.)
        So, according to what I’ve learned/been told, at least, when SD is training, it resizes the image. That’s how it works, as far as I understand it, but hey, tell me I’m wrong, please, lol. (I’ll probably update this section later with more accurate info as soon as I personally learn more.)
        When I heard about the resizing to 64x64, and recalling things Emad had said, along with previous things/conversations I had in chat about pixel art, it got me thinking about how SD was interpreting the data. 
        If you are not already aware, weights are actually more than just….weights. Having CLIP be updated/adjusted, etc, will help mitigate x, y, z. (There’s so much unexplored ground that it’s really hard to tell what’s happening, and I haven’t kept up to date, so, if some things are old news, forgive me.) In reality, though, there’s priority to objects in your scene, which is what I sussed out in the beginning. I saw it, figured I knew the general reason, but not the specifics. 
        (On a sidenote, there is a Git that someone created some time ago which allows you to see the priority of the weights, but I’ll have to find it.)
        Many of SD’s problems can be worked through with inpainting/outpainting/adjusting with prompts, etc. But what I am talking about here is at the fundamental level. Because there are issues that SD has beyond making monster hands, troubles with eyes, etc. 
        Okay, so where am I going with this? Well, about a week or so ago, though, I did some major testing to really figure out where some of these issues are, where they are starting specifically, etc. What I found out is pretty interesting.
The first question I wanted to answer was–what does the image look like at 64x64? (I could make all the images manually 64x64 and train them and see what happens. I did do that, by the way, but more on that later, hahaha.)
So I got out SD—YEAH, I JUST WHIPPED IT OUT OF MY POCKET OKAY!?--and started prompting. I’ve done so many tests with the samplers (so many unreleased……^^;;;;;) that I knew where to go with this plot pretty fast.
However, I figured that I wasn’t just going to go with poodles. Instead, I’d test several popular dogs. (I’m not going to make these images fancy or anything, for the sake of simplicity.) The phrase I used for the first batch was “photo of a labrador retriever.” This is due to my testing with animals in the sampler studies, as well just my general nonsense creating stuff with SD. I wanted to make sure that we were truly pulling from as much accurate data as possible, so I went with something realistic. 
(And yeah, sorry, these are gonna be super thicc, like me on my butter side, haha!)
All images on this picture are k_lms.




  



Here we start seeing semi-coherency around 192, but it’s hard to make out. For a lot of images, actually, there’s a lot of coherency at 256, and that’s pretty consistent across the board, in terms of when the shapes really start forming BUT THE QUALITY OF THE DATA REALLY MATTERS….BUT it actually isn’t the only thing, surprisingly. 
If you look closely, you can see all the kinds of trouble it’s having, and this is even more apparent if you generate more images. Some of them would certainly pass, even this is ADORABLE. 
What’s strange is the difference between 320 and 384, which appears to be a repeat offense. I’m not quite sure why; it’s like the disgruntled half-cousin, I GUESS. Or onions on my In-n-Out burger.
Anywho, I’ll leave you to study the rest of those small aspects yourself.
Next up, German Shepards! (Because we had a lab/shep mix named Lucky who loved eating lizards. I swear, the smog from LA went to that poor child’s head.)
The repetition, change in pose, caught my attention. I decided after that that I would need to make a LOT more images to really, really test this out. 
First, though, let’s look at just the base here. I decided to skip the first few, since last time the images just had the odd pattern. And, same as before, we had the same kind of issues. Only, these are, in my opinion, much worse. (Yes, obviously, we know that it’s getting a little messed up thinking it’s not a dog.) But more than that, in the smaller images, just compare them. It’s pretty clear that the data is just so much better with the labrador. 


  



        But just to show that this is more than just a few-image occurrence, here are additional examples for you at additional sizes:


  

30 images, 64x64


  
  

Photo of a German Shepherd vs photo of a german shepherd dog


  

30 images, 320


  
        
30 images, 384


Now that you’ve seen a pretty large sample size, as well as the other samples, and can see things like there’s a lot of blue and red in these images, which black often picks up, same as with most colors, 320 is still kind of in a weird spot, from what I can see with all of the tests I’ve done. (Really quickly, here, too, I also want to state I’ve done massive animal sampler studies as well. I just………………….haven’t posted them, AHAHAHAHA! If I do ever get around to posting them, you can just ignore this sentence…lol…….) 
But, really, those 64x64 images tell you a lot about the fundamental palettes that are trying to be created, I think. Don’t quote me on it, but it’s a THOUGHT.
If you have ANY experience with training whatsoever, you know that things can HAPPEN…colors can go absolutely WILD, if you don’t use the right kind of images, train too much, etc, so much can go wrong, ahahaha! So I think that if you’re going to be creating images for training, pick your colors carefully. This might actually really help you during the training process.
Going back to my original thought, though, I returned to the poodles. How would they stack up? Also, I decided to test the samplers for this, too, because why not make sure that there weren’t any additional variables, too? I could be screwing something up! 


  











Before I get into that, though, I want to note something that is both….incredibly stupid, yet incredibly important. Because it had my inside bitches in stitches. >:[ I didn’t find this out til later, but I want to point it out now.


  
        




        The prompt was something along the lines of “poodle, side view, realistic, long shot, summer.” Where in the fresh hell did those legs come along from? (No, not just saying this for satire, lmao.) Because, right before that, I used “poodle, side view” to create:


  



        I thought, well, that’s really kind of odd, isn’t it? You know, SD always doesn’t know what to do–photo, drawing, whatever? Usually if it’s people, you get a photo or an oil painting? But in this case, the poodle looks like we’ve got some black and white charcoal, a friggin felt mannequin body, partial grayscale pencil drawing, half quasi “photos.” And by photo I mean realistic representations of poodles.
Which throws us back to the question of asking what’s in the dataset.
Remember that whole….320 thing? And most of the images are getting better at 256 universally? (At least for animals.) Well, the quality actually really changes based on not just whether or not it’s a photo. And I was actually pretty surprised, because it’s not just a photo. (And yeah, I think that it associates it a lot with plushes, handmade items, paintings, etc!) In fact, I was surprised to find that a lot of drawings tended to come out better? At smaller sizes. It really depended on the medium.
Drawings, with charcoal and pencil seemed to have the best fidelity. And that’s just without any type of REAL guidance. But rather than just write, I’ll show you:


  



We can get slightly better results by using black and white photo. In fact, I actually did the same thing while training my own face. Color complicates art a lot. That’s why when you’re learning how to draw, you typically learn in grayscale/pencil when you start it. This helps you to focus on things like shadow, light and form instead of getting lost on subtle shifts in hue. An example would be this: 


  



        
When we remove the color, it becomes harder to tell if the picture we are looking at is a figurine, if it’s just a photo, etc, if the image is much smaller. (Although, with much more experience, you can, of course, figure a lot of that out.)


        


Lastly, here is a full evolution of pencil and charcoal to prove my point:




—----[WHICH IS SOMEWHERE, DEEP IN MY FOLDERS….SOMEWHERE…I’LL FIND IT…WHEREVER IT IS…..FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFT]---


You can see, too, that SD tried to compensate by putting in colored backgrounds, but it’s not really the same thing as being on Bristol smooth or Bristol vellum, or what have you. 
        Lastly, that stupid pillow-looking poodle thing.

WITH REALISTIC


  

  



WITHOUT


  

  



        Why? Every other time, it does the exact opposite. Just punch me. The pillows are more likely with the realism and the buzzcut chops. 
        And before you say anything about word prompts, or where I put them, or anything of the sort……..I have made…….so many poodles.
        But let’s get back to that whole image above—-


—----




The second reason I discovered this, besides my tests in textual inversion and fine tuning, which I will cover, and my sampler studies (as of 10/9/2022) was also because I wanted to see how SD would react to the word “animal.” This is because during my LSP prompting, I was surprised that it just came up with whatever. That’s why I just started putting “animal” to see what would happen.
People often ask, “Is AI sentient?” and I would have to say that first, we have to ask, “What is sentience?” Is sentience copying, and then being able to learn from that copying? Is that sentience? 
To me, honestly, from all that I’ve watched, and worked with, I’d have to say that the people behind all of this are brilliant, amazing, capable people. We are a collective of amazing people, really. And frankly, none of this would happen without people working together, and this technology is astounding. But, I don’t think that it is…sentient in the way that you might think of Data from Star Trek and all the wonderful questions that were explored during the series. At least, on this planet. For the rest of the universe—who can really tell?
If you think differently, by all means, cool beans.
But what I wanted to see in this question was—would SD actually just make a bunch of different animals—you know, elephants, tigers, horses, whatever. 
Naturally, since I didn’t put anything in, I sort of expected something, but not what I got out of it. Which, I suppose, perhaps, I might deserve for not putting in any kind of prompt whatsoever besides “photo of animal.”
The fact that it gradually started blending animals together, though, was an aspect I didn’t quite expect it to do, nor did I expect tigers to really be a THING. However, given the repeated tigers-overriding-past-prompts, it’s not ENTIRELY unexpected. 
—WAS I GOING TO PUT THAT IMAGE OF THE ANIMALS BLENDING TOGETHER HERE?? OR WAS IT SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE SAMPLERS? *Jeopardy theme ensues*


The other day (10/19/2022), too, I went through the effort of generating a bunch of images for a few extra bits of the 3 - ITERATIVE, BUT DEFINITIVE section of this study. While the problems with poodles are apparent here, the problem really just doesn’t apply to poodles, or wolves, but rather, in how SD approaches animals in general–THE EVERLOVING CHUNKY WAY.
Now that 2.0 is out, maybe that won’t be too much of an issue, but who knows. It was for this section, and therefore, I shall rant, since it’s still part of 1.5, and we shant ever give the power to rant about 1.5.
So, at this point, behind all this furry stuff, and all my yammering, you’re probably wondering why I even bothered, besides my insane curiosity, as to why I was bothering with this whole animal thing. The answer is this:


—


        That’s why.
        We’ll get more into that into Volume 2.
        Time for a more pleasant conversation about…

GENERAL SD TIPS:


                  * ORDER
                  * The order of your words matter.
                  * From my personal experience, I put the subject first, and if I am emulating a style, I put that last. 
                  * YOU CAN DELETE
                  * Once you have a solid picture, you can delete, rearrange keywords, etc, your keywords to adjust your result.
                  * REPEATING WORDS
                  * If there is something very specific that you want, sometimes repeating the word can help. 
                  * NEVER BE AFRAID TO GO BACK…
                  * To another seed. Some things in the past just need to be saved and the dumpster fire put out. 
                  * DATES ARE IMPORTANT
                  * Specific date ranges matter, meaning that you can specify how something/someone, etc, looked during a specific period.
                  * You can also specify a range of time, such as 1990-1992 AD. BCE, etc, are recognized.
                  * TEXTLESS
                  * If you want something to be textless, just put this at the start.
                  * HEIGHT/LENGTH
                  * For portraits, use a square.
                  * For a full body, use long length, smaller width.
                  * For landscapes, or long objects, use larger width, smaller height.

ART PROMPT TIPS:


There are a wide variety of art commands that SD accepts. While there is a full list in the Lexicon section, here are some general tips:


                  * YOU DON'T NEED AN ARTIST'S NAME
                  * I know a lot of people use names for style references and that is great. It's a fantastic way of speeding things up. That said, you don't need them.
                  * Instead, you can use generic words like vector or pixelart, watercolor, pencils, etc, to create what you want. 
                  * While this requires more steps, don’t be afraid of stepping outside of your comfort zone. 
                  * CAMERA ANGLES
                  * You can use camera angles to get what you want. This helps for getting the perfect shot.  I suggest studying various types of camera angles, but I am building a lexicon below and will be putting information regarding camera angles in it.
                  * CANVAS
                  * You can fill the canvas with colors such as white, gray, and black, etc. This is very useful if you want to do something like a blueprint, etc.
                  * Be aware that SD is bound to outsmart you for this attempt if you try to do something simple, and will typically try to make something fantastic.
                  * FROM GRAYSCALE TO COLOR
                  * You can start with grayscale and go to color. This is particularly useful if you’re trying to pin down a style.
                  * PORTRAITS
                  * You can specify things such as rosebud lips, an upturned nose, etc. 
                  * You can even put in generic things like "round features."
                  * Using words such as symmetry can improve faces.
                  * BETTER HANDS AND POSES
                  * If you want better hands and poses, for some reason, if you base things on photography, sculptures, or well-established painters or models, you have a higher chance of association than just throwing in your prompt willy-nilly.
                  * Having references like dolls, photographs, keywords such as realism or realistic help with this as well.

ANIMAL TIPS:


Though I have cataloged as many animals as I could, here are some tips for checking if there's animals/basic animal pics that are cute right off the bat: 




                  * Search for the animal using “photograph” first. 
                  * This is your best chance to see if  a specific species exists.
                  * Models, 2D and 3D images from games, etc can/will be used. 
                  * Please note that:
                  * Animals may be colored differently but may not be the species you intended. 
                  * Be specific; animals can be confused with objects/cars, etc. You can just use words like "Jaguar animal." 
                  * Using a generic term like cat or dog can wind up with various species or species being combined in weird ways. 
                  * For an easy, fast result, put:
                  * Animal, oil painting.
                  * Animal, watercolor and pencil.

Information from "The Old Masters" was obtained before the official release. As such, some of the wording has changed. However, it pretty much functions as it does before. You simply need to make sure that it has universal weighting.
FROM OLD MASTERS

If you want to create prompts from old masters or any time in history, you've got to know a couple of things:


                  1. Is the person famous? (Is the work likely in a museum, well known, in the dataset, etc? This can be tested.)
                  2. You've got to know something about art technique, history, or some kind of basic knowledge. At the very least, you need to be willing to read/use a search engine because an artist's technique can override keywords that you put in, especially if they are founders of certain techniques. (Yes, you can get around it.)
                  3. You've got to be willing to research the materials used on the canvas, etc, for the best result. 
                  4. Make sure you can view their work, as this is just part of the process.
                  5. Note that even local landscapes, animals, and architecture matter, etc.


(Because everything is changing so rapidly and this data was obtained before recent changes, please keep this in mind when proceeding.)
For this example, I will be using the master painters John William Waterhouse, Caspar David Friedrich, and Philipp Otto Runge.
Using a minor phrase, I can create humans, demi-humans, animals, semi-realistic animals, semi-realistic plushies/plushes/however you want to spell 'em, and plushes with varying fabric. Here are some examples:


  

  



  



  



  



  



  

  

  



As you might have noticed, there "seems" to be a lot of red, yellow, and sometimes blue tones going on in a lot of these images, and there's a reason for that.-_-
I chose these artists in particular for their subjects, use of color, backgrounds, and mediums. Typically, I try to pick them from separate categories, but if their work meshes together well, even if they draw similar things,  it can create a wide range of pretty dope pictures…so whatevah.
(Dope? Yeah, the 90's are calling and they want their lingo back.)
John Waterhouse was an English painter and I picked him as a study simply because I adore his Lady of Shalott painting. (Yes, Anne of Green Gables fans unite, haha!) His works focused on women, daily life in Greece, as well as mythology. And since I'm a die-hard fantasy fan, this was perfect for my needs. 
You can view his paintings here.
Waterhouses' paintings are beautiful, with a strong attention to detail. His colors are incredibly vibrant with a significant amount of contrast, and he captured both indoor and outdoor scenes well.
Caspar Friedrich was my spooky German man of the hour. His paintings were full of crypts, gnarled trees, abbies, mist, sunrises and sunsets with dramatic lighting in outdoor scenes. The pal never went halfway, because he was going to use those silhouettes to pierce your eyeballs and make you feel like you were in the piece. You were going to see those gothic ruins, stunning cliffs, wild seas, or calm mornings, and you were going to like it.
Philipp Otto…this fellow was a crimp in my behind. And, as you might notice, he's the last on my list, yet his influence and palette override everything to the point of me wanting to backhand him a few centuries, despite the fact he created the first color sphere. 
This German's paintings are the source of the cherubic delight, sometimes monstrous hybrids, in my prompt. He was a big guy for symbolism with his spiritual revolution of going against the grain of typical icons.
He also staunchly believed that red, yellow, and blue were the "only colors," and he decided to mix all his colors from said colors. He then created a color triangle, the lovely man. However, because of this, all of my images were coming out as red/peach/yellow/green! 
I tried switching the order but it meant nothing. I imagine this is simply because of his influence, which means that the influence of an artist means something. That said, as of the newer versions, this is less of an issue because you get a little more variety with less effort. That said, it's still present, so if you are having trouble, don't worry, again, there are solutions.
Now, for the record, for this particular prompt, -C 12.0 may or may not be useful. Seriously, it's situational. It will improve the quality of the faces, but it doesn't guarantee the extra appendages won't happen, and in terms of melding demi-humans, it can go both ways.
I also need to note that the kinds of animals and their colors/patterns/regional territory really do matter here, and I am going to explain the best solutions I have found. (As I continue to use this prompt, and/all info I learn will be added below.)

Why do these net these particular things?
IDK. Jk; it took me a while to put them together but that's what I have found to be the best for those specific things. I am going to hazard a guess it is due to the styles of these particular artists, their subject matters, blah blah, and whatever paintings that SD was trained on. 
You might have noticed, at this point, that my first sentence has to do with Precious Moments plushies. This is because I like to mix modern elements into these prompts, as they can just lift the entire piece and make it far more unique.
I want to note that while SD does recognize some PM plushes and figurines, I haven't found a way to bring up any of the houses/sets, if they exist.
Using realistic fur will give you softer looking fur/realistic animals, and tends to give you a less chunky look. Otherwise it looks like you took a hedge trimmer to your bear. If you put in the word plush twice, you might get more plushies than you bargained for, and it will often deviate from the masters' style of art.
You will also have noticed that I used "animal" a lot in my prompts, especially if you are in the server. Here's why:
Colors and creativity.
Using specific animals will work. That said, if you are using a tiger, it can override any color that you are trying to change. This will lead to things like strange patches of colored fur, which has about a 25% chance of looking cool. This is why I mostly stuck to animals that are less pattern-complex and region-specific to these artists, as they are more prone to being in their works, thus, more reference material and using animal means it can just come up with whatever blursed creation it feels like.
Remember the whole color palette thing? Well, the easiest method for figuring that out seems to be:


!dream "3 d precious moments plush cat with realistic fur and an blue / white / gray / green / pink / tan / mid pink / blue gray color scheme, snowy mountain landscape, master painter and art style of john william waterhouse and caspar david friedrich and philipp otto runge "


Which will give you things like these, and the colorful cats above:


  



  



Putting the color before the landscape seemed to work the best for me, but, again, your mileage may vary.
The best way I have found to see what a certain artist is capable of is to study their works, mediums, subjects, etc, and then gradually add and take away keywords to see what works.
One of the last things I want to point out is that these works have a very defined foreground, middleground, and background. 
This matters because when it changes the landscape, it really likes to change the background. Sometimes, depending on the reference, it will put things like ruins in the mid ground and subjects in the foreground by default.
It's really just super interesting to see it do that. 
Finally, here are some keywords that you can use with this prompt that work well, and it's an ever-growing list.
Thanks for coming to my SD Talk. :P

ADJUSTMENTS:


The prompt actually still works pretty normally without adjustments.


3D precious moments plush animal, realistic fur, master painter and art style of John William Waterhouse and Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge


  
  
  



3 d precious moments plush animal, intricate, master painter and art style of john william waterhouse and caspar david friedrich and philipp otto runge

        Etc. It’s all the same. I suggest:


                  * Randomizing your seeds, adjusting quality, changing samplers, being specific with animals, etc.
                  * Just overall following the og prompts for the best results, as the original “paper/guide” I wrote is still relevant. 
                  * Do keep in mind that that cherubs/children, that you might get BABY BOTTOMS like in these masterworks:
                  * John’s
                  * Philipp




If you’re looking for further suggestions, (steps/samplers not included) though, you can also do:


                  * For Landscapes
                  * 3D precious moments plush animal, realistic fur, in a snowy mountain landscape, master painter and art style of John William Waterhouse and Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge 
                  * Change this phrase for the landscape.
                  * You do not need to put “in a.” However, depending on the other keywords you might add, you may want to.
                  *                   * For Landscape & Color
                  * 3D precious moments plush animal, realistic fur, snowy mountain landscape, master painter and art style of John William Waterhouse and Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge with a purple orange yellow palette
                  * Use the words “with a” state your color(s) and then say “palette” at the end.
                  * In this particular case, I do keep the with a, but once again, you don’t always need to pay attention to grammar. 
                  * Examples:
                  * Cute wolf
                  * Adorable bears

                  * Others You Can Do
                  * Put in the name of real animals to curate, etc, much like the giant explanation of my LSP. :P

*HOW TO CREATE SPECIFIC THINGS


Creating what you want is why you're here. So, when it comes to things outside of style, there’s a lot you can do to make your prompt as functional/as good-looking as possible outside of the settings. If you are looking for information about settings, please check the official guides for the most current information.
Prompt generating, like many other things, is a skill, as well as just straight up knowledge. 


—-------- —---------- —------ —-----------  —---------- —------ —----------- —---------- —------ —----------- —---------- —------ —----------- —---------- —------ —----------- —---------- —------ —-----------
         —---------- —------ —----------- —--------- —--  —---------- —------ —----------- —---------- —------ —----------- —---------- —------ —-----------


WHAT DO YOU WANT?




        First, determine what you want. What does your scene look like? Who is in it? What kind of colors are going to be in it? What’s the focus?
        You don’t have to be specific, but the more specific you are, the higher chance you have at wordsmithing some gold. However, it doesn’t have to be THAT specific. You can be simple–that’s fine. 
        I usually write a jumbled mess–it’s perfect for this stage. Since I have ADHD,  I tend to either write a lot of haphazardly put together sentences or just put a bunch of words or phrases into bullet points. You should do what’s comfortable for you.
        For my example, I’m going to just use bullet points–this is also a great way to come up with ideas if you’re just not sure what to create.


                  * Beacon
                  * Lighthouse
                  * Cthulhu
                  * Lightning
                  * Storm
                  * Red
                  * Bacon
                  * Sunny side up
                  * breakfast


        Now, none of that makes sense, sure. In fact, I’m pretty sure if I put all of those words together, it would look incredibly weird, or it would take the first elements and do jack for me. In fact, here’s the result:


  
  



        Just as I suspected—it’s red! At least it’s ominous, except that one in the left corner. It didn’t even try–get out of here!
        Let’s go ahead and make a couple of sentences out of those words, though.
        “Cthulu seeing red after someone stole his sunny side up eggs and bacon breakfast, raging on top of a tower, punching it while a storm in the background rages.” (right images)
        While both of these are quite creative, they certainly aren’t what we want.
        So let’s break it down.

This is something that both the AI, and the users, struggle with. But, there are some things you can do to mitigate placement problems in your images.

GENERAL TIPS




                  * Check your spelling. While SD appears to be able to still figure out you screwed up some word, it's better that you spelled it right in the first place.
                  * Sometimes it helps to write first in Google Docs/e-mail/whatever.
                  * Keep a log of your favorite prompts. This can help you if you want to build prompts in the future, because then you can remember keywords and strategies you used to accomplish what you set out to do. Then all you have to do is swap our words.

-6 WORKS-


Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Today, we will be looking through six particular works of art that span across ancient Egyptian, Aegean, and Greek cultures.
        Each piece of art will have its own individual section that we will explore. First, we will discuss the Narmer Palette, followed by the Musicians and a Dancer. After, we will look into the Minoan Snake Goddess accompanied by the Toreador Fresco. Finally, we will dive into Kritios Boy and finish with The Sleeping Satyr. 
The Narmer Palette is a sculpture relief that has been thought to have been used as a cosmetic palette to mix the black paint that once protected Egyptian eyes from the sun (Egypt.)
        The first figure we noticed is King Narmer, bedecked in the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, “inspecting bound and decapitated prisoners (Egyptian.)” He is surrounded by hieroglyphs that depict his status as a Pharaoh—a son of the great god Ra. Note how large he is compared to his slaves. This was known as the “hierarchy of sale,” a technique used to show statues, or importance in the artwork. The bigger the figure, the more important they were (Egypt.) This is important because we can see just how much people respected, and feared, the pharaoh.
        The Egyptians used a lot of symbolism in their artwork, and were less focused on realism. “Artists developed the technique of presenting the feet and hands with no distinction between the right and the left. Additionally, figures were usually painted on a baseline and in a sequence, preventing the creation of any illusion of depth in the image.” Heads were also “traditionally show in strict profile” with the “eyeball...looking straight out at the viewer (Egypt.)” As we can see, the art was meant to make an impact upon the viewer. Despite the fact that these works of art were focused on symbolism, they were quite realistic in some respects.
        Consider the sense of texture on the relief. You can see the folds of the clothing on the pharaoh, the little ridges of his crown, and the pock marks that represent hair. The smooth, clean background provides a good sense of contrast in the piece. The palette is divided into rows to create balance and unity.
        Another thing to study is the shape and form of the muscles on the animals. These provide a sense of power and life. So do the lines which indicate the faces; they are easy to recognize.
        The entire palette is meant to be grand, and draw the viewer in. 
Let's take another look at more ancient Egyptian art.
As the New Kingdom emerged around 1550-1070 BC, the shift in style in Egyptian art is apparent. Due to the upheaval after Queen Hatshepsut's reign, the pharaoh Akhenaton “transformed [Egypt] from a polytheistic to a monotheistic society overnight.” Religious upheaval ensued as Akhenaton continued to make drastic changes (Egypt.)
        During this time, we can see how the figures became more realistic. The artwork began to display aspects of the actual people they were modeled after, such as elongated heads, necks, etc. We also “see much more emphasis on depicting movement in the New Kingdom,” such as in the wall painting, Musicians and a Dancer (Egypt.) (This piece was found at the Tomb of Nakht.)
        Let's study this wall painting.
        We can see the clear and total style shift of style by studying the eyes. While the pupil is still faced towards the viewer, the eyes are more almond shaped, which produces a very sultry look. This adds a lot more emotion which connects the viewer to the piece. The main emphasis of color is the dark skin of the Egyptian beauties as they perform. Their hair has flowing lines that show the figures in motion, and the soft, pastel colored background colors provide good contrast. The figures themselves are thin and elegant, switching the focus of symbolic to more of a materialistic, aesthetically pleasing style of art. It is also more erotic and indicative of the rapid change in culture.
        To continue, we will cover some of the art found on the Isle of Crete, namely, The Minoan Snake Goddess and The Leaping Bull Fresco.
During the Minoan time period, religion was a very important aspect of Crete. Many works of art during this Era were focused on this. “As evidence in the art of the period, the Minoans defied the natural world and found...a logical order that allowed man to live in harmony with the natural environment (Greek Culture.)” These works of art were heavily stylized, and focused on female fertility (Introduction.)
        However, not a great deal is known about the “written records about the lives of the Minoans. As a result, we do not have a clear sense today of the intended function of these pieces of art.” Such is the case with the Minoan Snake Goddess (Introduction.)
        Whether deity or mortal, this fantastic statue was “discovered in fragments and put back together (Introduction).” With a pinched waist, this statue shows the style of the period. There is a great deal of variety and texture with her wide birthing hips and large, open breasts. The alternating hues add contrast and vitality. The darker values seem to have some sort of rhythm around the arms. The statue seems to have a lot of round, twisting shapes. The pattern on the front part of the dress really sets off these rounder shapes and provides balance.
        Snakes, along with bulls, are known symbols that the Minoans used. The statue itself shows how mankind is blended with nature. It is possible that the snakes represent the role of female and male sexuality, but it can only be speculated (Introduction.)
The Minoans, as a whole, appeared to be a very vibrant people with a “whimsical approach to the world around them.” The colors tend to have very saturated blue and red themes. A great example of this is the The Toreader, or, the Bull Leaping Fresco below, also found in Konossos (Aegean.)
        The figure in red is theorized to be the great King Minos, most well known for feeding young women and enemies to the Minotaur in Konossos' labyrinths. Or, at least, that's how the legend goes.
        Notice how the fresco is all about movement. The bull's body is elongated with textures that seem to represent muscles. The King appears to have complete mastery of the bull with his aerobatic pose. He is the focal point because of the vibrant red color. Behind him, it looks like the figure on the right might be clapping, or reaching out, while the figure on the left appears to be taking the horn into her chest, as if welcoming the honor. If we consider the story, however, we might feel that the figure on the right is trying to save her sister or something of that particular nature, aka, something gruesome and sacrificial in nature!
        Regardless, this particular piece shows how important bulls were to the Minoans.
        The rhythm of the patterns really make this piece all about the movement. You can almost feel the bull moving forward as it leaps because of the balance.
        The colors are very complementary, with the blue and orange being the significant, dominant colors.
        All of the figures have tapered waists, which, again, was the style of that particular Era.  
The next step of our journey will be to look at the marble statue, Kritios Boy, which was made
during the Classical Era (ca. 480-400BC.)        
To fully realize the importance of this piece of art, we must understand the society during that time. This began with the defeat of the Persian army during the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC. The focus of Greek society at that time was spending the funds for “financing the defense[s] of the Greek city-states” for art. During this period, the art style began to develop as figures became less rigid and more natural (Greek.)
        Statues were a large part of this movement. Statues were “viewed as prime evidence of artistic creation...of man's power over raw matter and nature (Studying.)” By creating and placing statues in cities, it showed the wealth and grace of Greek society. It showed ingenuity, creativity, and a lofty sense of superiority. However, that was not the only reason for these types of statues.
        The more important statues of the era were used to grace the temples of the gods. These were often depictions of the gods themselves, and served in religious practices of the period (Greek Sculptures Made.) The statues themselves were made to look fantastic with a high amount of detail that adapted to the new style of consistent proportion.
        Kritios Boy is a highlight of this shift in style. One of the more noted characteristics of this statue is the pose, called “contrapposto.” Basically, it is “when you shift your weight on one leg” while the other “balances your weight. This pose is what makes it a Classical sculpture, as opposed to an Archaic sculpture. This shows complete mastery of the body's ability to balance (Greek.)
        The face of the figure is somewhat stoic. However, the body structure is idealized. (Like many ancient and modern cultures, Greece had their own system for defining what made a beautiful body.) The sculpture has a very toned form, with a strong neck and ample proportions. It is very symmetrical,  with a great deal of subtle changes that make the muscles stand out. The texture of the body is very smooth, and the hair has many deep grooves that make Kritios Boy have a very kempt appearance.
        It's hard for me to imagine how people were able to chip away at the stone to create such magnificent curves. It really was a sign of how advanced people had become. The peaceful times really made it possible for art to flourish.
        However, that peace was not about to last. “The Golden Age of Greece came to an abrupt end when Philip of Macedon, and later his son Alexander the Great, conquered and controlled Greece.” No longer was Athens the great and proud city that housed one of the great minds of the world—Socrates. The war against Sparta had taken its toll. The plague that ravaged the closed city reduced their numbers significantly due to the pride of the king. They even reduced themselves to blaming Socrates and administered the death sentence of the time—hemlock (Greek Sculpture.)
        Smaller cities were now capitals that sprawled across the land. As the Hellenistic Era moved forward, artistic style changed. No longer were the gods so heavily regarded; the people felt lost. Instead of heralding the gods, they put their emotions into their art and left the gods behind. “Sculptors began to favor depicting scenes and figures in a highly emotional...state (Greek Sculpture.)” Art also became more erotic. Such is the case with Sleeping Satyr, located below.
Unlike the stoic approach of previous Greek art, this statue has a great deal of emotional expression. The figure itself is much more accurate and life-like than previous statues. His entire body, from the way that his toes are spread to his arm wearily reaching back, as if to stretch, exudes this content. The pose itself is sexualized, but the expression is very distinct, as if he might be weary.
        The overall texture of the body is very delicate, from the fur on his tail, the cloth on which he lays, to the natural texture of the stone. All of this contrast brings the piece together in a form of unity that has a great deal of realism. The mass of the rock is apparent when compared to the smooth stone of the skin and the body is perfectly balanced upon it.
        To be honest, when I first saw this, along with Aphrodite, Eros, and Pan, I had to laugh. My first thought was, “The world's 'first' furry porn!” From what I understand, however, it has been theorized that satyrs were linked with disease due to their constant erections. In other words, STD's., and this was the peoples’ way of immortalizing that–fun!
        The pose really reminds me of modern day model magazines.
        However, I was impressed. All of the details put into this are stunning. To think that someone could have that skill and time to craft that is truly breathtaking.
        I'm not particularly fond of the subject, mind you, because I'm not really one for reading stories about mythical love hexagons.I imagine the artist really wanted to make his or her audience feel the life in it. Perhaps it was a tribute to all the legends surrounding the satyrs. It makes me want to talk to my Greek friends about their lives and how the art around them impacted their own artistic journey.
        In closing, I hope you have enjoyed your journey through this tour of ancient art. It is a fascinating world with many styles to study and ponder.

-A TOUR IN ART-


During the fifth century, Etruria was not enjoying the rule of the Romans. After the last of the Etruria kings had been banished, the Cumaean Greeks and their fellow Hieron of Syracuse dealt them the final, and defeating blow. No longer were the Etruscans the great warriors and monarchs of the sea; they were reduced to virtually nothing. Their delicacies—their gold, their silver, their fine jewels and fine arts--were gone. Yet, the art they did create formed its own legacy (Gardner.)
        One of the most well-known of these works of art is the Capitoline Wolf, found in Rome. This legendary hollow-cast bronze wolf became the surrogate mother of Romulus and Remus when they were orphans. The story goes that Romulus and Remus fought amongst each other until Romulus killed Remus. While the sucking infants were actually added during the 16th century, the wolf tells a powerful story (Gardner.)
        Her body is tight and balanced, with the forepaws clutching the rock. Even without the figures below, it is easy to see that she has cubs, due to the enlarged breasts. The gaunt look of her rib cage produces a malnourished look; nonetheless, the texture of the rough armor on her sinewy neck makes her appear powerful and strong. The sculpting of the muscles adds to this look (Gardner.)
        While her body appears to be tense, with her ears up, listening, she also appears to be panting. The compelling look in her eyes, however, shows a softer side of the wolf. Her expression appears to be a bit kinder, as if she is a dog, looking up at her master for comfort. Or, perhaps, she is concerned for her cubs.
        The overall mass and form are expressed very well through the shapes of the muscles. While the actual statue is hollow, the strength of her body makes it seem heavier. The children below are the focal point. However, the original statue had the focal point as her face.
        The texture on the armor is very significant, and adds variety. While this has a limited use of texture, the style provides contrast between the muscles and the armor to break up the monotony.
        The figure appears balanced with the legs spread apart and set firmly on the ground.
        This particular style of art shows its grounds in Etruscan work. When the statue was found, it was not thought to be Roman because the Roman style of art was still emerging. This emerging style can be seen in the next work of art---the Temple of Portunus.
        The year of 211 BC had a huge impact upon Roman art because of the legendary man, Marcellus. After the take over of Syracuse, the Romans lusted after Greek art because of this man's conquest. It was the sensation of the era; so much so that many of the Roman ships parked in Ostia Harbor sold their spoils of war constantly. As Rome continued to abolish nations, their thirst for Grecian art grew. While the building blocks of the Roman style art architecture was remembered, a new, electrifying style emerged (Gardner.)
        A great example of this change is apparent in the senate's commission of the Temple of Portunus, dedicated to the god of seaports (Gardner.) Temples during this period were an exciting, and important part of everyday life. As the Roman Empire grew, so did their list of important Gods. Shrines were often built inside of homes so that the Romans could worship their gods at any time (Mandy.)
        They would pray for all sorts of things. For example, Roman soldiers believed that the God of War, Mars, chose who died and who vanquished their foes in battle. One way of pleasing the Gods so that you didn't die was to create temples. (To disgrace the gods was to bring indefinite misfortune.) To further please the Gods, the Romans made blood sacrifices in the temples and presented gifts during worship. Thus, it was important for the government to create and maintain these temples to preserve the overall order and power over the people (Mandy.)
         Roman architecture was a lot less lively than Etruscan art. Placed on the East Bank of the Tiber, the Temple of Portunus follows the Etruscan blueprint. Made of travertine and lufa stone, this building was then covered in stucco to imitate Ionic Grecian pillars. Included on these pillars are flutes, bases, and complete friezes. Around the back of the temple, half columns were placed to maintain a partial Etruscan temple look. However, the large flight of stairs in the front are like the Grecian style of art that produces an overall unique look (Gardner.)
        Artistically, the height of the pillars allow for a good sense of space, and overwhelm the viewer. The pillars also have a lot of rhythm with the long lines, which give the structure a very bold look. The embroidery of the temple provides a great example of texture, and the peaked roof gives the temple a sharp and distinct look. The pillars are placed evenly, allowing the temple to be unified and balanced.
        Everything about this temple has a clear tie to Grecian art, despite the general layout. (The general layout is the defining factor, however, in showing artistic roots.) The large porch in the front is clearly Etruscan. Unlike Greek art, the Etruscans tactically made the front of their temples distinguishable from the backs. But, Greek temples typically had stairs on all sides while Etruscan temples did not. Etruscan temples did not have fluted columns, either, and “because of the lightness of the superstructure they had to support, Etruscan columns were, as a rule, much more widely spaced than Greek columns.” Also, Etruscan temples had wood, not stone, columns (Gardner.)
        Knowing this, the combination of the two styles can be readily seen. But how did the influence of these styles change later Roman art?
        Romans became known as the masters of the arch. This “helped to redefine interior space.” While Grecian columns were still used, the arch made it possible to expand interior space. The Romans built arches on a “monumental scale.” With their ingenuity, the arches were often placed with barrel vaults, which made it possible to create long arch sections (Roman.)
        One other important thing to note is that the Romans created waterproof concrete. This concrete was less expensive to make and stronger than other known materials like brick and stone. Engineers would use the concrete to form structures over wood, then paint over the material so that it looked more exquisite. That way, the Romans could still look superior, but have more money on hand. In the 21st century, something similar to this style of art can be seen in Vegas at the casinos (Roman.)
        As Roman style art progressed, their architecture became more and more centralized. This can be seen with the Baths of Caracalla in Rome (Roman.)
        The Baths of Caracalla were very modern, and large enough to hold 1,600 customers. They had “libraries, lecture halls, and exercise courts in addition to bathing rooms and a swimming pool (Roman.)” The Romans knew the meaning of luxury, and were on the forefront of making these amenities possible.
        The concrete vaults have long since collapsed; however, by looking at the nave of the Santa Maria degli Angeli church, viewers can get a good idea of what the Baths looked like. “Although the Renaissance interior has many new elements foreign to a Roman bath, its rich wall treatment, colossal columns, immense groin vaults,” arches, “and clerestory lighting give a better sense of the character of a Roman imperial bathing complex than does any other building in the world (Roman.)”
        But how were the Baths of Caracalla different from the Temple of Portunus? By observing, the viewer can use technical terms to explain the difference. This is why using artistic terms is important because then other viewers can talk about the subject.
        Like previous Roman architecture, the Romans used scale and proportion to create a sense of awe. The variety in color creates a sense of grandeur. The columns are very strong, but the use of the carved ceiling is what makes the lighting and interior space so impressive. The columns, in contrast with the round arches, create balance and lead the viewer to the next hall or room. Despite the fact that the Baths of Caracalla was made with concrete, it is these arches that define this later artistic style.
        Overall, the Romans grew in their ability to create more massive, and more impressive works of art.
        It's time to move on and explore Early Christian art.
        Early Christian churches like Old Saint Peter's are very different from buildings like the Temple of Portunus. The building of worship differed greatly from the other buildings in Rome. Rome's Old Saint Peter's was made around 319 BC, dedicated to the Christian God. Commissioned by Constantine, this church stood as a tribute to God's help during Constantine's campaign. He was the eager first patron of Christian architecture in Rome, and chose to place the church where Peter, one of Christ's apostles, had been buried (Gardner.)
        While the present-day building is a replacement, old plans are still available to study. The building plans of the temple show that the style of the building was reminiscent of the Roman basilicas, like Trajan's Basilica Ulpia. Needless to say, the Christians did not want their building to resemble any of the Pagan shrines. The desired look was difficult to obtain (Gardner.)
        Old Saint Peter's features a wide central nave, with long aisles and an apse cap. Before it came a large, open courtyard named an atrium like the Forum of Trajan. Christians were able to enter through the vestibule. Upon entering the nave, the worshiper was able to enjoy the grandeur of the church (Gardner.)
        Looking at the painting attached, the splendor of the church is apparent. From the colors that can be seen, the green and yellow set off the neutral color scheme. The brown pillars for the atrium provide a perfect focal point as well. The nave columns lead the viewer to the apse, too. These “framed the altar (Gardner.)”
        The texture on the walls via the painting are very intricate. The brown squares on the floor of the hallway offset the round shapes of the arches. The pillars offset the hallway by providing balance and unity.
        Unlike the smaller temples of Rome, this building was large enough to house 3,000-4,000 worshipers at a time (Gardner.) This made it possible for Christianity to grow in Rome, which was one of Constantine's goals.
        But what ties these two different buildings of worship together? What makes these two structures different?
        The structures were equally made for religious practices, and both served as a way to enforce them.
        Structurally, the pillars and raised platforms are some one of the main elements that tie both of these buildings together. The blueprints for both are radically different, with Old Saint Peter's being astronomically larger with quarters for priests to live. The pillars, similar in style, both provided ample balance and unity to the buildings. Both also have intricate carvings, but Old Saint Peter's did not house the usual large statues. Old Saint Peter's was the grander of the two because it contained not only paintings inside, but frescoes, mosaics, marble, various precious metals, jewels, and altar cloths. Old Saint Peters also had a great many windows which brought in a vast array of light. The overall architecture is far more open and inviting (Gardner.)
        In conclusion, while both buildings have roots to their initial style, it is easy to see how the artwork evolved with political and religious changes. What other art during this Era can we explore to see evidence of these changes?
        A great deal of knowledge about Early Christian art has yet to be found. “Most Early Christian art in Rome dates to the third and fourth centuries and is found in catacombs.” The catacombs were made out of tufa rock, much like the old Etruscan burial chambers, and “housed as many as four million bodies.” While much more extensive, the catacombs were less extravagant (Gardner.)
        The earliest works of Early Christian art were found here, and are known as funerary works of art to honor the dead. This tells us just how important family members were during this era (Gardner.)
        These works of art were often painted in small, circular rooms named cubicula, and served as small chapels. The art within these circles often told a story. Such is the case with The Good Shepard, that tells the tale of Jonah (Gardner.)
        The pictures outside of the circle represent key parts of Jonah's story.
        Jonah's story is about a man who was told by God to preach in Nineveh. Jonah was scared, and so, he ran. When he got on a boat, the sea turned tumultuous. After casting lots, Jonah was thrown off the boat to save the sailors. For his punishment, Jonah was swallowed by a sea creature. After three days, the beast spit him out upon dry land.
        The story itself can be easily seen in the painting. For example, on the left hand side, the sailors are tossing Jonah into the ocean. On the right, Jonah is emerging from the whale, and on the bottom, “safe on land, Jonah contemplates the miracle of his salvation and the mercy of God (Gardner.)”
        The bold, red and blue lines divide the piece into sections to view, with the focal point being the man in the center. The swift, round lines create movement, as if the piece is a wheel to be studied.
        The main colors are blue, green, and brown. The figures inside the lines have less saturated backgrounds, which makes the figures easier to see. The white background allows for even more contrast.
        Most of the figures are evenly proportioned. The main use of scale that can be seen is in the center, where the two cats lay next to what is thought to be Christ.
        Outside of the main circles, a man, woman, and probably a child stand with their hands outreached. In this context, the figures appear to be praising God in prayer. These were called orants, or, “praying figures (Gardner.)” Because the hands point towards the center, it adds more unity to the entire piece, leading to the focal point.
        Like previous art styles, portraying known religious characters was a very important part of Early Christian art. While these are paintings, as opposed to large sculptures, they still show how significant religious practices were (Gardner.)
        These figures focus on telling the story as opposed to being focused on beautiful proportions. It appears to be less materialistic. The clothing is simple; there aren't a lot of folds or high energy emotions. The simplicity is what really sets it apart from other eras. Unlike the Etruscan form of art, the piece is not as energetic as its predecessors. All of this compound is another huge example of how the religious movement within Rome was changing rapidly.
        To continue learning about this shift in style, the tour will now cover Byzantine art.
        “Nothing in Middle Byzantine art better demonstrates the rejection of the iconoclastic viewpoint than the return to prominence of painted icons.” During this period, the public was caught up in the buying of restored images for private and public buyers. During the 11th century, the clergy set up icons in a sort of hierarchical fashion, with Christ being the head, followed by His apostles, on the templons of their churches. The Vladimir Virgin is one of the many descendants of these types of work (Gardner.)
        The Vladimir Virgin is a very abstract painting, due to the constant revamping of these icons of art. This shows just how obsessed people were with the Christian viewpoint. While the artist is not known, it is theorized the artist was probably from Constantinople (Gardner.)
        This painting has the characteristics of Byzantine art, through the “virgin's long, straight nose, small mouth, the golden rays on the infant's draper, the sweep of the unbroken contour that encloses the two figures, and the flat silhouette against the golden ground (Gardner.)”
        This particular painting's context is Mary as the Virgin of Compassion. Her eyes are partially closed, creating a somber, and somewhat sad, look. Supposedly this was to represent her contemplating the Atonement where Christ would give His life for the world. Christ appears to be comforting His mother by placing His cheek against hers (Gardner.)
        The texture and line on the babe's body make it seem very round. The subtle change in color shows that while this painting is abstract, it still meant to keep to some form of realism. This is truly evident in the faces by looking at the colors chosen and studying how smoothly the colors blend.
        The texture of the gold and rhythm of the patterns on the embroidery also lends to this realistic look.
        The black makes it possible to tell the difference between the figures and the background.
        The scale and proportion of the figures makes this painting clearly abstract.
        This painting is different from the previous paintings discussed due to the more realistic blend of colors, and the more abstract look. The abstract look is the most prominent feature that makes it different from paintings like The Good Shepard. Like many previous paintings discussed, this was a religious icon that got worn out. This can be easily seen by studying the smoke marks on the painting from candles set below it.
        In conclusion, whether paintings or architecture have been used for religious or non-religious practices, every piece has been shaped by its social and political climate, and fascinating in its own way.
        This concludes our art tour.

-Early Renaissance - Mannerist Art-


Art is an experience. Today, this art tour will experience six works of art through the following periods: Early Renaissance, High Renaissance, Northern Renaissance, and end with Mannerist Art.
        To find art without some sort of meaning can make the viewer uneasy. According to the Gestalt theory, when humans view art, they attempt to understand it; they want to find some sort of meaning, some way to comprehend and process it. The easiest way to grasp the audience's mind in this manner is to relate to them in a way that they can understand. This can be done through the context of the subject, focal points, line, color, etc.
        Humanism is the tangible result of these concentrated emotions pulled from the human psyche. It is the embodiment, the expression, of what makes us human. It brings life to art, and draws in the viewer. During the Renaissance Era, humanistic art returned. Pieces became less abstract and ethereal, and became more realistic. Artists began using principles like perspective to produce depth and clarity. Secondly, artists began to take more notice of small background details, and moved away from focusing on the main figures alone. People really began to explore human interactions with their environments. Lastly, the figures became less majestic and idealistic.
        The Duke of Berry commissioned the Limbourg Brothers to create a sort of calendar book. The images were very unusual because they were “highly influenced by their patron and incorporated the artists' observations of the world around them in a way that was not done before (Early.)” This can be seen in January's image, known as Les Tres Riches Heures. In this painting, the duke can be seen hosting a very fancy New Years Eve banquet. Like previous images of Christ, he is “surrounded by a mandorla (early),” representing his worldly fame and spiritual status. The Duke really wanted to represent himself as someone who had a lot of good aspects to him. In other words, he wanted to appear social and charismatic, which he did by commissioning the calendar pages. It was a way that he could show his social graces and impress his guests and subjects through visual means.
        There is a lot going on in this painting. The use of perspective gives the entire piece a sense of depth, and shows the grandness of the party. The focal point appears to be the left hand corner, where the horses are prancing merrily, and the party goers seem to be having a fantastic time. There is a lot of movement in the corner with the pennants waving, and the people appear to be streaming down to the Duke, who is not idealistically beautiful. The deep, rich blue color also provides a lot of contrast, and visually roots the other colors in the painting through a sense of weight. The box form around the painting makes the viewer feel like they are looking into some sort of three dimensional space in time. All the little details such as the dog, the patterns on the textiles, and texture on the gold really give this piece a lot of life. Combined, these aspects clearly portrait the Duke's desire to be liked.
        Of course, the Duke was not the only one who wanted to be liked. It was natural for people to commission artists like Jan Van Eyck for big occasions. This particular oil painting, known as Giovanni Arnolfini and His Bride, was a very popular piece during that time and helped to modernize oil painting styles. Featuring an “Italian financier and his wife (Gardner),” the artist not only captured the emotional intent of the scene, but placed himself in the mirror for all to see.
The painting is quite interesting. The figures have a lot of personality, and due to their fine clothing and background, they clearly show their wealth and power. However, there are a lot of nuances that make up this painting, such as the expressions of the faces and the dog. Perhaps the financier wanted to show that he was a loving family man, and he could manage pets with his household, and that his grace extended to all. Or, perhaps, his wife really wanted to show her fondness for the dog. Yet, it could have been used to make the painting seem more amiable, since pets tend to be considered good and not evil. But why was this made?
        One thing to note is that due to the roundness of her stomach area, she might have been pregnant, and this could have been a wedding gift, or even a painting to celebrate the birth of a child. The title of the painting points to either one of these options as the main reason, with a show of wealth and power being secondary, though just as important. Regardless of the reason Arnolfini commissioned the portrait, this piece is very fine with a lot of rich colors, texture, and details.
        The folds on her clothing are impeccable, and the texture on the fur coat is also exceptional. The use of color on the chandelier shows how subtly the colors and atmospheric lighting enhance the figures. The focal point appears to be the center mirror, however, the eye is immediately drawn to the woman, due to the contrast brought on by her green gown. The perspective is very well done, with the carpet showing this and the scale, angle, and proportion of the window. The shoes on the floor add a bit of variety, and overall, the two figures with the mirror acting as a counterweight add balance.
        During the High Renaissance era, Pope Julius II ordered Old Saint Peter's to be destroyed. However, he planned to erect an even more stunning Saint Peter's that still stands today. In order to build this place, he appointed Michelangelo to make the basilica. While Michelangelo died before his work was completed, he was able to “finish the construction for the basilica from the foundation to the base of the dome (Gardner).”
        Why did the Pope decide to change Old Saint Peter's? The style of the basilica is very different from the original in a lot of ways, like the use of domes and an overall rounder look. Yet, the windows appear to be reminiscent of what Old Saint Peter's would have looked like. So, while a lot of the aspects of the basilica were changed, though they did pay tribute to the past.
        It is possible that the Pope simply wanted to update the cathedral. The newer architecture would have certainly made an impression, and, probably a sign of the Pope's grand power. However, by destroying the old, he was showing dominance, triumph, and obliteration of the old ways. Still, showing the roots, like the windows and straight, strong walls meant that he cared a little about the original architecture because the Romans still influenced how the cathedral looked. In the end, with the new renovations, “The Church wanted to change the function of the structure, as well as make a visual statement, so, the nave was extended and the facade was added in order to convey the power and glory of the Catholic Church (High).”
        The cathedral is very tall. The scale and proportion make the viewer feel small. The windows are very straight, and the forms they create contrast the round dome, and the buildings around it. The texture and round loops under the dome create a sense of movement, and appear to be really detailed. The spire on top of the dome points to religious significance with the cross as well, and gives the viewer something to look up at in awe. Overall, the building has a lot of variety due to the use of carvings and different shapes. There's so much contrast, but it's balanced well.        
        There is a lot of contrast in Northern Renaissance 16th Century paintings. This is due to the artistic expression of Protestant and Catholic churches. Because the churches were so prominent, their ideals were passed on through their works of art. Such is the case with Netherlandish Proverbs, which “depicts a Netherlandish village populated by people acting out over 100 Dutch proverbs that held a great deal of importance to the Dutch (AI.)” But how can someone tell that this is that type of art?
        In order to determine this, it is important for the viewer to study each little scene being played out. For example, there is a woman in the middle of the painting who is throwing a blue cloak over her husband. Her neckline is very low, and there is cleavage showing. Most of the figures are fully clothed and very modest, which shows the conservative, religious style of art. Yet, the blue cloak is a proverb about a dastardly woman deceiving a person's husband. The blue color means “faith and purity, becoming the color of foolishness and folly (AI).”
        Figures of importance are shown by color, like the woman seducing her husband's innocence. The use of perspective makes it possible to break up the figures. The brick wall breaks up the monotony of the ground, and adds some interest to the piece. The emphasis appears to be upon each individual story being told by the set of the figures, like the map that might be digging his own grave, and the two men sheering their sheep. A lot of the figures seem to be moving, with the arms and legs in motion, and the cloth folds swaying and bending.
        Speaking of swaying and bending, in a “new style of art emerged called Mannerism” in 1520 that had “disproportionate figures, enigmatic themes, and contorted poses (AI.)” Frankly said, the art was very strange.
        One Mannerist artist was Parmigianino. He created the painting Madonna and Child with Saints Anne, Peter, and Sebastian. The painting style was formed as a violent reaction against classicism. At first, the painting might appear bright due to the orange and blue contrasting colors. But, as the viewer looks at the painting, he or she begins to see other aspects, such as the sad look on the man to the right, or the grayed out skin. Because of the Black Plague and past events, this is very significant. The man on the left has an arrow in his neck as well, so something is not quite right. The child's expression also does not appear to be happy, and Madonna does not appear to be pleased, either. Like past paintings, the figures surround the central figure of Christ with the mandorla.
        While this is a religious painting, it seems that the artist was trying to make an alternative statement with the subject matter. The colors are very dark, and the background is very simple. The composition is balanced by the portrait of figures on the bottom, and the focal point is the babe and mother. The darker, yet still vibrant, colors on the figures to the right and left add to the overall balance of the piece. In some circumstances, people might even consider this piece something that resembles satire.
        Who this piece was for is not known. Because of the religious upheaval, pieces like these were quite apparent during the time. Other than that, not much appears to be known about why these were created. Perhaps Parmigianino wanted to create art that resembled the classical realistic styles, but threw in twists to make the viewer intrigued. Either way, it's a religious piece, and bound to get attention. People become angry, or interested when they see something different. It sticks out from the normalcy of daily life, and like the 21st century, religion was a very hot topic that made sparks fly.
        This theme of startling art, however, is more apparent with Parmigianino's Madonna with a Long Neck. Here Madonna is seen as if looking proudly, or happily, upon the babe. Everything is ultra realistic, from the movement of the folds, to the weight of the body, though the limbs are elongated and the babe looks more like an alien, or small child. The colors are very neutral, save for the splash of red in the background, and the green. These colors seem to be very popular in these types of paintings. This child, supposedly, however, is dead. Look at the color of the babe's skull, which is darkened. The onlookers seem to have a lot of different expressions, as if the context hasn't quite set in. The faces range from curious, to mature, dull, understanding, and sleepy. The scale and proportion for the figure on the bottom right is a little odd, and seems to be a man holding some sort of record, or account. The shadows for the columns are a little weird, too, because they do not follow the proportion of the columns themselves. The focal point appears to be the face of Madonna, and while the painting is majestically crafted, it's also disturbing.
        What makes it so disturbing? Perhaps it is the idea that religious art is sacred, and to have Christ dead with so many onlookers just seems wrong. The artist gave Madonna such a kind, caring, yet somewhat haughty face. This sort of peaceful look with rosy cheeks would bring in the viewer because it does not look menacing. It's sort of like throwing a Gothic-style bloodbath into the middle of a painting of a rainbow. The intent of the piece seems to be disturbing. Whatever symbolism is meant, or for whom it was created, however, is up to the viewer to decide.
        It is interesting to see how these works of art developed and sometimes, seemed to change overnight. In the end, though, a lot of the old art style seems to be found with the new as people built upon what they knew to become better artists.

To find art without some sort of meaning can make the viewer uneasy. According to the Gestalt theory, when humans view art, they attempt to understand it; they want to find some sort of meaning, some way to comprehend and process it. The easiest way to grasp the audience's mind in this manner is to relate to them in a way that they can understand. This can be done through the context of the subject, focal points, line, color, etc.
        Humanism is the tangible result of these concentrated emotions pulled from the human psyche. It is the embodiment, the expression, of what makes us human. It brings life to art, and draws in the viewer. During the Renaissance Era, humanistic art returned. Pieces became less abstract and ethereal, and became more realistic. Artists began using principles like perspective to produce depth and clarity. Secondly, artists began to take more notice of small background details, and moved away from focusing on the main figures alone. People really began to explore human interactions with their environments. Lastly, the figures became less majestic and idealistic.
        The Duke of Berry commissioned the Limbourg Brothers to create a sort of calendar book. The images were very unusual because they were “highly influenced by their patron and incorporated the artists' observations of the world around them in a way that was not done before (Early.)” This can be seen in January's image, known as Les Tres Riches Heures. In this painting, the duke can be seen hosting a very fancy New Years Eve banquet. Like previous images of Christ, he is “surrounded by a mandorla (early),” representing his worldly fame and spiritual status.
        There is a lot going on in this painting. The use of perspective gives the entire piece a sense of depth, and shows the grandness of the party. The focal point appears to be the left hand corner, where the horses are prancing merrily, and the party goers seem to be having a fantastic time. There's a lot of movement in the corner with the pennants waving, and the people appear to be streaming down to the duke, who is not idealistically beautiful. The deep, rich blue color also provides a lot of contrast, and visually roots the other colors in the painting through a sense of weight. The box form around the painting makes the viewer feel like they are looking into some sort of three dimensional space in time. All the little details such as the dog, the patterns on the textiles, and texture on the gold really give this piece a lot of life.
        Later on during the Renaissance and Venetian Art age, humanism became even more apparent in works of art, such as with Feast of the Gods by Giovanni Bellini.
        The background is exceedingly lush and dark, and provides contrasts against the light merry making figures. These figures have more details, and while some of them lack the materialistic beauty, most of the figures in this painting are fairly beautiful. The richly saturated dyed fabrics show a royal status, and the rich, small details like the rocks, pail, bucket, etc, add so much to the composition. There is a lot for the eye to see with the various textures as well, from the leaves on the trees, the folds of the cloth, and cracked earth. The focal point appears to be the lady in pink with the slightly promiscuous maid behind her with a jar on her head.
        Both of these pieces focus on merriment and enjoyment. The first seems to have Christian roots, while the second appears to be more pagan due to the satyr, style of outfits, etc. Also, the first seems to have a less-natural looking perspective due to the box and flatter figures, while the second has a more natural feel to it because of the 3D application of space. Each was crafted to expound upon the nature of mankind, and to show how skilled the artists were through composition and inventing more principles of art. The second is more honed due to the sense of color, use of perspective, depth, and form as well. Each is unique to their time period, but both open the doors to show us how artists were really excelling and compelled to become better.

-Baroque-


The battles for the souls of mankind are often waged through various mediums. During the Baroque period, the Catholic and Protestant churches were still at each other's' throats. Naturally, each side was trying to outdo the other, and in consequence, some very interesting styles came to pass due to the conflict. What would catch the eyes, hearts, and minds of the people? What would make them great? What would make them remembered? Perhaps they felt if they used a dramatic art style, they would make their mark on history.
        Caravaggio was a very well-known painter during the Baroque Era for this style of painting. He often created religious works of art that related to everyday life. Yet, “Caravaggio's use of shadow and light, called a tenebristic approach) was his stylistic hallmark and added a heightened sense of drama to his paintings (AI.)” Perhaps this dramatic approach to art was a symbol of his rocky lifestyle permeated with personal and financial trials. Caravaggio seemed to have a vendetta against the masters of the High Renaissance with their beautiful atmospheres and idealistic portraits. He wanted to convey a sense of realism that captured the moment in action, which didn't always sit well with the religious leaders. Not everyone wanted to have the same beliefs about the gospel of Christ. This drastic realism and sarcastic attitude was captured in many of his paintings. Such is the case with the Conversion of St Paul.
        The message in this painting is quite clear—either Paul would have to shape up, or he was going to get a beating. The shapes of the muscles on the horse are very strong, and anyone who has had their foot stomped would understand the context. His body is in motion so that the viewer can tell how precarious the situation was as well. The lighting is very harsh, and some of the colors are sickly gray tones with yellow hues. The focal point is the horse's face while it tensely chomps on the bit, with the older man behind him. Paul is very saturated compared to the rest of the painting with his orange and green colors, but his skin has a less rough texture and seems a little more idealistic than the other figures.
        “In contrast to Caravaggio's scandalous works and social ostracism, Gionlorenzo Bernini was both popular and a good friend to the Pope (AI.)” His works of art followed the Baroque Era style, which was fantastic religious scenes, coupled with dramatic everyday life scenes and a great deal of movement. This movement can easily be seen in Bernini's sculpture of David.
        Bernini used his skills to amplify the heavenly splendor of Biblical stories. This was very important because during the era, the Catholic Counter Reformation occurred. Church leaders were desperate for followers, and, like per usual, they turned to artists to quell religious squalls and increase patronage and obedience.
        The Catholic church did not want to hold back, so they commissioned Bernini to create several pieces. Bernini was able to capture the rich folds of fabric in motion by applying the principles of physics like gravity into the swell and swoop of the forms. A great deal of emphasis is placed on the context of David ready to fell his foe. The curly hair resembles a lot of past Roman statues, but the face is not as flat and emotionless like previous sculptures. The variety in the color of the stone with the little specks gives the viewer something else to study with the subtle curves of the stone. The statue is also well balanced with his right foot bearing a great deal of the weight.
        However, not all works of art were for, or against, the Christians. In the Arrival of Marie de' Medici at Marseilles, “Marie disembarks after her sea voyage from Italy (Gardner)” as Neptune and the Nereids joy in her arrival. This piece was commissioned after her husband, King Henri IV, died. Marie wanted to decorate her new home, the Palais de Luxembourg, and show her passionate prowess and illustrate the glories of her political career. The first set of paintings was to cover her career and life while the second would show the life of her deceased husband.
        The focal point of the piece appears to be the busty maidens below, due to the lightness of their color, and scale. They are much larger than the Queen of France, though she was meant to be the most important. The rich gold colors and overall grandness of the painting is very busy, and the people greeting her with open arms show the joyous context. Despite the many figures, the painting is balanced due to the alternating colors and lighting. The rich, saturated reds break up the composition as well, adding variety and tying in the balance. The texture and attention to detail are meant for the rich and famous.
        During the Rococo Era, people began to move away from drastic religious works of art, and began to focus on their pleasures and interests. Such is the cycle with many cultures; they bind together, they form a belief system, they rise, intellectual natures are stimulated, and because of it, different types of art begin to flourish.
        Much like the Humanistic art in Greek culture, Rocco art played upon the fantasies of the human mind. Paintings were elegant, whimsical, and often sexual in nature. This dramatic turn in art once again began to look back at the old Gods and Goddesses, such as Boucher's The Toilet of Venus. Here Venus is being pampered by her servants, the cupids. She has a sort of adoring look to her face, yet, there is wisdom and a hint of mystery to her.
        The lighting is very soft, and the colors of the skin are somewhat rosy and flatter. The pattern on the cloth around her provides contrast because of how smooth her skin is. The texture of the vases, roses, and various precious metals and jewelry have a realistic shine, and add a bit of grand context. What she is contemplating the viewer would have to decide, but with the way she is being dressed, and the emphasis on her vanity, the viewer might wonder if she is going to some sort of party.
        Unfortunately, “Rocco artists like Fragonard who were working at the end of the 1700's were out of fashion due to the French Revolutionary forces...Many artists no longer received commissions (AI.)”
        One of the forerunners of Rococo style art was Antoine Watteau. He was famous for creating what is called a fete galante, or, outdoor scenes of the rich and famous. Because of his abilities, he was accepted into the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, even though they had to create a new category of art (fete galante) to admit him.
        “Watteau fete galante paintings depict the outdoor amusements of French high society. The haze of color, subtly mottled shapes, gliding motion, and air of suave gentility match Rococo taste (Gardner).”
                This composition has a lot of variety through the various people and colors. The artist used scale and proportion to break up the figures and bring balance, with the focal point being the man in orange in the center on top of the little rise. The little rising cupids show movement, as well as the figures falling, kneeling, and leaning against each other. The pastel sky contrasts very well with the greenery framing it, and the individual figures tell their own stories of their relationships.
        Watteau paintings were the hallmark of high society. Watteau had reached the pinnacle of exquisite art, and his charms appealed to the aristocrat's vanity. Sadly, Watteau died at the young age of 37. Thankfully, Jean-Honore Fragonard carried the burden of the Rococo style through his lifetime. In The Swing, the “pastel colors and soft light complement a sensuous scene in which a young lady flirtatiously kicks off her shoe at a statue of Cupid while her lover watches (Gardner.)”
        This painting is very playful, with the soft colors accentuating the delicate promise of youthful frolicking. The folds of her dress show movement, as well as the bent ropes of the swing. The plopped over lover adds balance to the composition, and provides a focal point for the painting. The cupid statue on the left is holding his hand to his mouth, as if to hush the sinful twist of nature and add a sense of naughtiness to the context.
        Clearly, many of the Rocco paintings do not hide sexual fantasies, and often promote it. This is a very huge contrast compared to the very strict religious paintings of the Baroque Era. With the rise and fall of each era through political changes, the paintings reflected the minds of the people. The tense nature of Baroque paintings had faded, yet, art was about to change yet again with the political climate.

-Romanesque Era-




 This week's tour will cover the enticing worlds of Early Medieval, Carolingian, Ottonian, Romanesque, and Gothic art.
        After Rome took a dive, it became imperative for the leaders to keep control of the people. They abolished paganism when various tribes took control of the land again. To fill the void, they began to replace holidays, and introduce Christianity through works of art. They even stole the forms of art used by the pagans and began carving them into stone sculptures, manuscripts, and even on wood carvings to be used in their churches. In the end, medieval art often existed to enforce religious practices and communicate with the locals.
        One of the most well known ancient sites is the ship graveyard of Sutton Hoo. This ship shows a great deal of the pagan way of life. A shoulder clasp that was found with interlacing “designs of abstract, serpent-like animals whose heads terminate on themselves (Early)” similar to the Ouroboros. This ancient symbol symbolized the “Nature of the Universe: creation out of destruction, Life out of Death. The Ouroboros eats its own tail to sustain its life, in an eternal cycle of renewal, and was first found in Egypt around 1600 BC (Ouroboros.)”
        Similarly, this could have also represented the “dragon,” or, Satan, in the Bible, but historians aren't sure. While the artist of the clasp is not known, this could have been made by monks, or by tribesmen themselves who were converting to Christianity. The clasp could have easily been used to mark and influence the tribes that roamed around by being a constant reminder of Christianity.
        The clasp is very bold and detailed. It is clear that the artist intended for this to be a significant piece of work. The bold red colors contrast the gold weaves. The titch of blue, white, and black also add a sort of depth and pattern to the piece. The pattern on the edges, while they do tie in, color wise, with the rest of the piece, seem a little out of place. This could be because the figures are hard to see and understand, or because of the composition and balance.
        Nonetheless, this is clearly a professional piece of work meant to be grandiose, just like many of the other works found at Sutton Hoo.
        This gorgeous purse “combines interlace ornamentation with animal figures---a hallmark of early medieval art in western Europe (Gardner.)” Like the previous piece discussed, this was created for the warlord for his afterlife. Many of the ancients believed that in order to have a perfect afterlife, it was necessary for royalty to have goods in the afterlife to take with them. Because it is a purse, it is likely that this was more of a secular, over religious, piece. However, the “combination of interlace with animal figures was uncommon outside of the realm of the early medieval warlords,” so it is possible that the figures themselves might have religious significance to royalty.
        Whoever looked upon this piece probably thought that it was very grand, or even sacred. The deep red, blue, and gold colors are very rich and delicate, and match the clasp in style. The purse itself almost seems weightless. Covered in gems, this purse has an elegant and streamlined look. The bottom ring creates a sense of movement, and because the figures are very symmetrical, the viewer can continuously study the purse. The inner patterns also have this sense of movement and rhythm, and everything is very unified. It has a very dignified look. Lately, it seems tied to how the pagan tribes thought and acted because of the animal symbols.




















        Symbols have always been an important part of society. Through symbols and writing, we can communicate our thoughts, our feelings, and show our creativity. Political and economical climates, of course, influence these symbols.
        In the 800's, Charlemagne, or, Charles the Great, was crowned king by Pope Leo III. He was a lover of the arts, and adored classical culture. It is said that Charlemagne's “dearest projects [were] the recovery of the true text of the Bible.” He endeavored to return the text to its natural form, as well as turn them into something that could be drawn in the viewer. He absolutely adored books, both religious as well as secular, so it was natural for him to embellish the Book of Kells, or, the four gospels of the New Testament.
        Is is said that “opening to the Gospel of Satin Matthew, the illuminator transformed the biblical text into abstract patterns[s], literally making God's words beautiful.” This religious art touched the souls of those who viewed it in a powerful way. It made the stories in the Bible more real to the people of the time. Even people who could not read could still appreciate the intricacy of these designs. It was also an offering to God by beautifying His word.
        This design is all about the little patterns that make up the larger piece. The black line around the letter and cross make it possible to see what the artist was trying to illuminate. The cross adds that bit of religious context. Movement and rhythm are abundant in this piece. While the pigment has faded, telltale signs of bright colors can still be seen. Sadly, the overall image, while ornate, is fairly crowded. There might have been more balance and unity by adding a bolder line around what appears to be letters to distinguish it from the background.
        This piece of art is still a testament to Charlemagne's artistic legacy. This religious piece clearly communicated its elegance to any viewer, regardless of their educational background. It's important to note, however, that these scripts were likely purchased and maintained by the wealthy due to the sheer amount of time it took to inscribe and create them by hand. It is unlikely that very many citizens of common status had access to these works.
        After the reign of Charlemagne, his legacy still continued. The Ottonian era picked up where the fall of the United Holy Empire art style ended, but added the materialistic Byzantine style in order to show their power. Because Otto II was wed to Byzantine royalty, it is theorized that this is the reason for the return to Byzantine style. The tie to Byzantine art can be seen in Christ in Majesty, manuscript page. Much like previous eras, this religious piece of art tells a story through the smaller figures that surround the central figure of Christ.
        Christ is the focal point. His feet are bloody, representing the Atonement and His crucifixion. He appears to be holding some sort of religious text, which likely had some sort of contextual meaning during the era. Behind Him is the golden halo typical in earlier Christian art. Characterized by rich Byzantine colors, this is a very bold illuminated script. The patterns are contrasted by the flat colors, and the color scheme seems to have mostly complimentary colors, such as red and green and blue and orange. This gives the painting a very original texture that adds to the variety and unity of the piece.
        The actual artist is not known, but more than likely, this painting was created to be used as a teaching tool for introducing Christian beliefs. Perhaps it was used to instruct the rich and the poor. Historians can really only speculate at this point until further documentation is provided.
        
















        During the Romanesque Era, building beautiful white churches was the pinnacle of architecture. As always, religious buildings were important, and the desire to grow as a society flamed the fires of ingenuity. Unfortunately, the knowledge of concrete faded with the Romans, so these churches were built with large blocks of stone. However, that did not mean that the Roman way of building was forgotten; in fact, Roman designs and engineering were still prominent in these churches.
        This can be seen with the Cathedral of Santiago, with its round arches placed throughout the church. The side isle along with the gallery are fantastic examples of how Roman architecture was still used. Consider the nave, for it is bedecked in long barrel vaults, which does not allow for many windows. This is clearly built upon Roman architecture, despite the fact that the church was built with stone, and not concrete.
        During the course of history, however, this link to Roman architecture was buffed out. The facade and exterior of the church were changed during the Baroque era. Yet, the influence of Rome is still clear, as can be seen in the side aisle.
        The side isle is elegant, with the gold reflecting and producing a warm, inviting color of light. The height and spacing of the tall arches narrow down to provide a focal point to the altar. The gold engravings are a perfect example of rhythm and texture. All of this boils down together to create an ample sense of unity and variety.
        This building was then used for pilgrimages. The long isle itself allowed pilgrims to pass through and enjoy the sacred relics inside.
        Right along with the theme of building places of worship, the Gothic Era continued this trend by constructing grand cathedrals. “The rapid urbanization of Paris under Louis VI and his successors and the accompanying increase in population made a new cathedral a necessity (Gardner.)” Known for their height and sharp rib vaults, Gothic cathedrals like Notre Dame can still be enjoyed today because of something known as a flying buttress. This came about because Bishop de Sully was intent on competing with his fellow religious colleagues with his masterpiece, Notre Dame. Nevertheless, in his exuberant haphazard desire for prestige, he did not create intricate plans. Like many of his predecessors, this created a lot of problems for the engineering and construction teams. So, flying buttresses were designed to keep the structure together.
        But what is a flying buttress? A flying buttress is a gargantuan block of stone fitted into the walls at the edges to “help with the lateral thrust of the vaults. The flying buttress on the exterior is like an arch that helps to alleviate the weight and outward trust of the nave vaults without covering the large stained-glass methods (Gothic.)” Essentially, this supported the weight of the building, and allowed for the placement of open windows that brought in a great deal of light.
        Notre Dame certainly used the buttresses to their advantage. The scale and proportion of the building is impressive, despite the shift in style. It is fairly easy to see how the plans developed with the building, disrupting the unity of the church. The towers on the left are a good example of this, due to the large arches and very closed bottom without circular windows. These spherical shapes are contrasted by the sharp edges of the peaked roofs on the rest of the building. Regardless of this, the windows are very intricate, especially the main window over the entrance. The shapes create a good sense of movement, as if the individual parts are spinning.
        Now that these two works of architecture have been discussed in detail, what are the similarities and contrasting factors of these buildings?
        Both of these buildings show how important it was during these eras to build religious buildings. These buildings were fueled by the economy, and in return, fueled the economy. Like previous buildings of worship, these churches are very elegant, and required great craftsmanship to create. These buildings moved away from previous eras where simplicity was an important part of everyday life and they moved away from the Roman style of architecture. The churches and cathedrals required a great deal of planning, and both buildings show a shift in style that changed the overall look drastically. Nonetheless, the attempts to make cohesive styles can be seen, as previously discussed. Each building drew people from around the region to it, and made it possible for the poor and the destitute to get a taste of the grandeur that he or she might enjoy in heaven. Thus, both buildings served similar functions and did them in such a way that many were impressed.

-A Tour of Neoclassic and High Victorian
Gothic Architecture-


The McCook Mansion is a long-standing High Victorian Gothic Building in Pittsburgh, PA. It was built in 1907 by the McCooks (Rayworth.) 
The mansion features the High Victorian Gothic style with a long, swooping roof, decorative cross gables and dormers spotted with patterned chimneys, and contrasting colors of brick accents all around the building (Late.) 
The following features are drawn in detail on the next page: arched window and a patterned chimney, typical of the style.

Neoclassic Architecture


  

City-Data. Capitol Hill, Washington D.C.   Digital image. City-Data. N.p., Web. 18 May 2014.


Capitol Hill is one of America's fine examples of Neoclassic Architecture. It was built on Jenkin's Hill in 1793 in Washington D.C. The main features of the style are: Simple geometric forms, symmetrical shapes, triangular pediments, domed roofs, gargantuan scale, and plain walls complemented by dramatic columns (Editors, Explore.) 


The domed roof can easily be seen from far away. Its grand scale produces a sense of awe. The symmetrical balance is beautiful, and the columns provide a good focal point and balance. The steps create a good sense of weight and power, and the peaked roofs clearly point to the Neoclassical style. Overall, it is a grand building, plain, yet immense in personality.


  

The McCook Mansion


As previously mentioned, the McCook Mansion was built by the McCooks, a very prominent family in Pittsburgh. Willis McCook wanted something that would stand out amongst the crowd for his wife and ten children, and so, the English Manor was built (Rayworth.)
Covered in intricate carvings, soft lighting, and exquisite woodwork, the McCook Mansion was a center for parties and all types of gatherings. Unfortunately, the house was lost when the McCooks passed away once the Depression came. 
During the 1950's, the McCook Mansion was purchased for $28,000 by the Bonavita family. They started renting rooms to college students, screening students to make sure they would take care of the home. But in 2004, there was a fire in the third floor and attic, forcing the home to be closed. The home was put up for sale, but the “Bonavita family vowed not to sell to anyone who would demolish the home (Rayworth.)
The home was saved by Mary Del Brady and Richard Pearson, who took their time and money to create and restore the interior of the building. At first, they planned to make it a bed-and-breakfast, but soon decided to go full on and create a full-service hotel and “hall” of sorts. It retains the original items, like the woodwork, fireplaces, light fixtures, and such, but is updated with modern amenities. 
Capitol Hill


In 1790, Congress passed the “Residence Act,” which allowed for the District of Columbia to become the housing center of government functions. In 1791, President Washington designated the area what is now Washington D.C., to be the new city of Washington, which was planned by Pierre Charles L'Enfant. 
As the country grew, so did the need for more buildings. In 1793, the U.S. Capitol Building began construction. As the nation continued to grow, the Building was enlarged to accommodate the massive crowd until 1892, where it came to its final resting point in terms of appearance, except for the East front extension and Courtyard areas.
Because of the rapid growth, the Library section was removed from the building, and given one of its own. Separate buildings were then built to accommodate what the Capitol Building could no longer hold. 
In 1910, more modern conveniences were added to the building with the construction of the Capitol Power Plant, which provided steam heat and electricity. It continued to go through massive renovations in the 1930's, allowing for more modern conveniences. Places like the Senate Office Building's First Street Wing were built, along with the James Adam Building, Dirksen Senate Office Building, etc. Through the 1970's, two more buildings were added as well. The last renovations and additions to the buildings were made in 2008, when the Capitol Visitor Center became available for the public to visit (Explore.)

Nothing really says “millionaire” like building a lavish home for everyone to see, just like the High Victorian Gothic style was meant to be. There's something fascinating about the limestone and granite exterior, which leads the viewer to believe that this home was not only grand, but was a striking pillar in the community that showed America's architectural prowess.
The house is imposing and beautiful with its stained glass windows, decorative plaster molds, and fantastic fireplaces; there's even a fireplace with knights riding upon their hoses. The breathtaking woodwork has made it perfect for a now turn-of-the century hotel that features the Formal Dining Room, the Oak-Room, thirteen guestrooms, in-house bar, breakfast, and fitness room. There is also a Library (Pitz.)
All of these things come together to prove that it was meant not only for large amounts of people, but the Dining Room allowed for large banquets, the Oak Room like a parlor, which meant that it was perfect for a large family. It had such warmth and personality that many, many people fell in love with it, which led to it being carefully restored. Color palettes were carefully chosen during the renovations to make sure that they would compliment the old style, but a commercial understanding of design and color were used. Now it is fully restored and regal, ready to visit and enjoy (Rayworth.)


Capitol Hill


The more people there are, the more buildings are needed. It doesn't matter if you start out with four people. If you multiply that by two, you get eight, and in a house that has two bedrooms suddenly gets a lot smaller.
This same concept can be applied to the Capitol State building. While the history has already unfolded, it's important to note how some of these changes came into play. First, it began with the library being booted to what is now the Thomas Jefferson Building. With this, more and more separate buildings were created to accommodate all the people.
In terms of construction, the north wing, which contained the Senate chamber, was created first. As the building passed from architect to architect, it was embellished with different style aspects. Benjamin Latrobe was well-known for his Corinthian-style columns, which have a symbol of wealth in the form of tobacco leaves, plus corn cobs, which represented bounty.
The south wing was finished in1807, and became the House of Representatives. The British roasted the Capitol in the War of 1812, but a lot of damage was avoided due to the rain. Still, it had to be rebuilt in 1815. Latrobe started the project, but resigned two years later and left the gauntlet to Charles Bulfinch of Boston. He decided to join the two wings and built the “first copper-sheathed dome,” which was made in the image of Thornton's original work (Bigler.) 
Some time later, the French Historian, Alexis de Tocqueville, gave the Capitol a scathing review, which spurred on more work, making the Capitol Building larger.
In the end, a lot of things---people, political reviews, and economical influences, made the building what it is today (Bigler.)

Architecture 1600 & 1700's


  

Woodward, James L. Paul Revere House Boston MA. Digital image. Wikipedia. N.p., 17 Nov. 2009. Web. 11 May 2014.


Paul Revere House, 19 North Square, North End, architect/builder unknown, c. 1680.
The Paul Revere House is a Post-Medieval style, nestled against many modern buildings. It features the iconic diamond window panes, overhanging floor, overtly large chimney, and timber frame that follows the typical European style.




  

  



Rococo Architecture Style


The Paul Revere home is Boston's oldest historical building, and one of the very last remaining homes of this style.
It was built in 1680 and built over the Second Church of Boston---a religious building that was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1676. Four years after the fire, the home was built.
First occupied by Robert Howard, a well-to-do merchant, the home was eventually changed from a two-story townhouse to one with a raised roof line and third story to accommodate more people. Howard eventually sold the building to the Revere family, which consisted of Paul, his wife, five children, and mother (Paul.)
The home itself eventually served as a place for the Revere family to come to; while they owned the home from 1770-1800, they did not always live there.
The home is built in a Post Medieval English style, which features very steep roofs, overhanging floors, undecorated cornices, made of timbers with stone or brick sides, with the top floor generally made of plaster. Windows were typically fairly small, generally casement-like with diamond-shaped panes. Doors were made with vertical slats, much like the fronts of many of these buildings. Chimneys were typically very large, sometimes made with decorative tops, and had an overall Old World appearance (Architectural/Traditional)
Truthfully, "the Post Medieval English form is not a true architectural style, but is a traditional type of building brought to the colonies by the early English colonists." This was an attempt to bring the old world to the new, to bring in a sense of familiarity that people could cling to. Also, most of the colonists relied on their previous culture to create their homes. In later years, during the 1900's, this style was revived, and it's very difficult to tell the originals from the remastered style at first glance (Traditional.)
The Shirley-Eustis home was the crown Georgian style jewel of William Shirley, Royal Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Built as a symbol of power on a 33 acre state, it was meant to impress and show off the grace and power of England, and, finally, France (Historic.)
        The house went through many, many owners.
Somehow, the villa managed to avoid damage, even during the Siege of Boston. Six years after it was built after the death of Shirley's son-in-law, Eliakim Hutchinson, who had owned the estate, the Hutchinsons fled to England. The house was then passed onto several French refugees, and various people throughout time (Historic.)
As the house went from owner to owner, it was renovated to become a blend of Georgian and Federal architectural style, such as with the "floating staircase (Historic).”
The Georgian style is known for its symmetry, usually two stories, and either made of stone or brick. Homes are adorned with front-entry pilasters and multi-paned windows with decorate quoins gracing the corners. The door was typically in the center as well. These elements can clearly be seen with the Shirley-Eustis home (Colonial.)
Due to weather conditions, many buildings that once stood are now gone. This is due to several factors, which is why, as Colonial America grew, so did the availability of materials which lead to buildings that could withstand elements such as wind, rain, hurricanes, deep snowfall, tsunamis, etc (A Guide.)
Many of the buildings were made with wood. Since wood deteriorates easily, many of the original buildings, such as wigwams, are no longer standing and replicas have been made to show what they look like (A Guide.)
As Colonial America grew, everyone benefited from the new materials of stone, which many homes were eventually built with. This allowed the colonists to protect the wood beams and prevent them from weather and infestation. Stone was readily available in most regions as well, which is why its popularity grew as well (A Guide.)
Eventually, stucco and adobe were used with a great deal of the Spanish styled buildings in Latin America. Meant for hotter climates, the roofs of these places were generally thatch, earth, or clay and were very rustic, and could not be built farther up north (A Guide.)
In the end, many of the colonists had to leave a great deal behind to come to the New World. Yet, they were still used to their way of life, and brought their knowledge and desires with them. A lot of bumbling happened along the way, such as with the Post Medieval English style, but they ended up creating a lot of amazing homes which we can now use to understand our history (A Guide.)

-ARCOSANTI-


Arcosanti is a city in the middle of the desert, close to Phoenix. Thought of in the 1950's, this "green" city was built in the 1970's, and is still an on-going project created by Paolo Slorei. It is built in the arcology sort of style, where the phrase "less is more” meant that the forms were very simple and easy to comprehend and use. Its main features are its cleanliness, use of solar panels, materials from the surrounding region, close proximity buildings, round shapes, domes, and "green" style of housing meant to blend in with the landscape (Arcosanti.)
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was the champion of "less is more." The Chicago Federal Center was built in 1974, and is a combination of three different buildings. It features the post modern style, which is minimalistic in nature. He believed that no decorations were needed, and the sleek, functional design focused on using vertical I-beams, and double height ground floors, with black and bronze coloring to make a very distinct statement (AD.)
Arcosanti is a place of its own culture; a place where people can come and learn about how to make a cleaner planet and how to preserve the environment. It's also about the study of arcology---combining architecture with the landscape. With about 50,000 people that visit annually, it is continually growing, and always progressing forward. This is why there are workshops, and people come and stay in Arcosanti while continuing their other pursuits, such as writing and web design.
As of right now, the “city” supports approximately 5,000 people, with about eighty people currently residing in the city on a regular basis, and is only about 5% complete. So, there's still a lot to be built. One cool thing is that many countries have had their hand in the continual building of it, including the US, Italy, Canada, and even Japan!
Most of the materials used are from the surrounding area and put together by volunteers. It is a developing style as people continue to grow, pull together, learn from one another, and try to make the world a better place. Arcosanti thrives on donations from people all around the world and the sale of the Soleri Windbells, which are ceramic and bronze bells, which can be purchased for around $30 a piece. This allows the Corsanti Foundation to8continue to fund the project, and to teach people how to use architecture with the environment (Arcosanti.)
“Arcology is Paolo Soleri's concept of cities which embody the fusion of architecture with ecology (Arcosanti.)” It fights against the idea that more land and more consumption are needed to sustain people. It's about connecting with the earth and getting back to our roots by using and creating clean energy. (While only a small percentage of the city uses solar power, they are continually growing with funding so that the entire city will be able to harness the energy of the sun.)
His idea was that people ought to be able to get together in small places, that they should be able to walk to where they needed to go, because most cities devote at least 60% of the city to roadways, thus creating more pollution, etc. Essentially, the idea is that humans ought to be able to work, play, and enjoy each other's company without having to go through miles of traffic and angry people.
Soleri wanted to be able to use less waste, and use things like local agriculture to “stay off the grid.” It's a really neat concept, and is focused on being more conscious of the things that people use daily so that resources are not so limited, and that things like solar roadways can become mainstream, and fossil fuels can be eliminated (Arcosanti.)
Chicgao's Loop District was in need of more buildings. They needed a place to consolidate agencies so that everyone could work together more efficiently. Miles van er Rohe was a very popular man of his time and was well known for his modernistic, minimalistic views, and so, he was commissioned as the top guy to create them.
Originally, two identical buildings were meant to be built for the Treasury, Defense, Justice Departments, and Federal Courts, but, eventually, three buildings were proposed to accommodate the Post Office.
The Court House part threw its doors open wide in 1964 whilst the old Court House was roasted by a hardy demolition team in the meantime. Two years later, the other buildings were implemented, and in 1973, the Post Office opened, and in 1974, the Federal Building was finally finished. The Court House was renamed in 1969 due to the past senator, Everett Dirksen. The Federal Building was also renamed after John C Kluczynski, a US Rep in 1975.
The Buildings cover about two blocks, and are very striking in appearance. While the Post Office is only one story, the others tower in pride together with black graphite paint gracing their sides. As previously stated, the glass is actually tinted bronze, which is accented by aluminum and “separated by steel spandrels,” which creates a lot of simple, yet astounding presence (Federal.)
Miles was the kind of guy that felt that no ornamentation was necessary; buildings were meant to serve functions, and functional it would look. When a person walked up to the building, they would be able to tell what was going on, and they would have a professional vibe from it (Federal.) Using his trademark high-rise blocks and open spaces, he really did a good job to continue the Modernist tradition (AD.)
The buildings really expressed his ideology that he wanted to make it mainstream—that is to say, he wanted everyone to pretty much go, “You know, let's rot out the pompous stuff and make everything just straight and to the point.” The stiff, tall geometry was one of those features, along with the I-beams, and “double height ground floors which try to reduce the barriers between indoors and outdoors (AD.)” He wanted to do away with the grand idea that government buildings should be so impressive and a ridiculous amount of materials and money should be used—it was wasteful. Some people really didn't like that; it hurt their pride a little. Yet, it doesn't seem to have hurt his career much; his modernist buildings are still standing, after all (AD)!

-ART DECO-


The Warner Theater was built in 1929, premiers the Art Deco style, and was created by architects Rapp & Rapp in Erie, Pennsylvania. This fantastic building shows off its rich decorative elements through its reliefs upon the smooth walls. Its tall, linear shape allows the viewer to understand its majesty, and the set back front facade with the ticket booth really gives the place depth. All these aspects really come together to show off the Art Deco style (Erie.)
The PSFS building was created in 1932 in Philadelphia, PA, and was designed by William Lescaze, and George Howe. Its lack of ornamental details, along with its flat roof, rectangular forms, and smooth surfaces herald it as the International Style. It was a miracle among buildings, was fully air conditioned, and completely “modern (PSFS, Yale).”
The Warner Theater was built to impress. That's why the bronze banisters, archways of marble, gold gilding, Czech glass, crystal chandeliers and flowing drapery were used by Rambusch Studios. It was built with the following phrase in mind, “Twice as rich, three times more fanciful than life.” And, even though it was constructed during the Depression, it still cost 1.5 million dollars. The interior is neigh irreplaceable, and it is a huge historic landmark and entertainment center nowadays (Erie.)
The Theater opened in 1931, on the 30th of April. With nearly 8,000 colored lights, it was built with entertainment as its highlight. Several travel shows and plays debuted there, and because of this, a spot was made for a grand organ to be placed. Eventually, the grand organ was given to Western Reserve Chapter of American Theatre Organ Enthusiasts in 1969. Yet, many shows were still held at the theater. For example, in 1974, the Erie Philharmonic held its first concert there, and since then, has continued to perform (Erie.)
In 1876, the Theater had a close shave when it was about to be demolished, but the mayor scooped it up, because he understood the building still had an important role to play. He had a vision of the Theater continuing its role as an entertainment center, and with the help of the commonwealth, he was able to purchase and save it. He then proceeded to replace the roof, and restored the interior wiring, etc. This allowed for further profit for the town, and allowed for many future shows, such as Broadway musicals and more (Erie!)
The Theater is still active today, and brings many people together.
The Philadelphia Saving Fund Society Building was unique among other skyscrapers. It was the first International Style building, and is thirty six stories high. It also has a tower, and has been heralded as a truly innovative example of architecture (PSFS, Yale.)
The building itself is a real collaboration between the bank's president, James M. Wilcox, Lescaze, and Howe. At the time, Howe was new to the Modernism style, but Lescaze had a good foundation in it, which really led to this blend of such an innovative style. So many of Europe's well-known architectures also played a role in creating this style as well. A lot of expensive materials were used, which will be looked into later (PSFS, Yale.)
What makes it so unique was the creation of all the mechanical amenities and the overall structure. These elements furthered architecture in general, such as the use of escalator entrances, “radio outlets in every office, nearby garage facilities, high-rise elevators, thermostatically controlled heat, and a rooftop observation platform (Yale.)”
The building was going to be destroyed after the parent company's financial troubles, but the Loews Corporation picked it up in 1997, and renovated the building while still keeping its original design. Nowadays, it has been turned into the Loews Philadelphia Hotel, and is still enjoyed by many people (Yale.)
Coming by expensive materials during the Depression wasn't easy, for those who couldn't afford it. Something so luxurious as the Art Deco style really required it.
The style itself was meant to break the mold. The style is known for setbacks that create an outline, along with low-relief decorative panels that frame entrances and windows, along the edges, etc. Typically, these buildings are made out of stucco, glazed brick, mosaic tile, or concrete blocks. Motifs were truly the name of the game, and, as the name states, it's very “artsy.” In fact, the style itself even helped the creation of new clothes, jewelry, and even furniture! However, the style was mostly used with skyscrapers, “post offices....schools, armories and apartment buildings (Modern.)”
Motifs were generally zigzags, chevrons, or something very geometrically interesting. The style was focused on rejecting the ideals of the past, as often happens with new forms of art. It was also very popular with theaters, hence, the Art Deco style was used for the Warner Theater. The murals and light fixtures and glamorous marquee of it speak volumes. They also say, “Come one, come all, and enjoy our fancy theater and be amazed by our productions and our regal nature (Modern.)”
The Philadelphia Saving Fund Society Building had something that other buildings did not---it showed off what the building was meant to be. Different materials were used for each part, so that the viewer could tell what was going on. The bottom of the building was made for retail stores, and was made of polished gray granite. The base is T-shaped, and helps hold up all the stories above. The back of the building is covered in glazed and unglazed brick, which adds a lot of contrast because other parts of the building are sand and colored limestone. The windows gather together to create a sort of layered effect, which leads up to the office portion of the building. Once again, the horizontal lines created a striking appearance in the architectural style, yet, vertical lines were also added to break up the overall design and add unity (PSFS.) The interior is also very exciting, such as with the bank room, which has a very high ceiling with desaturated colors complimented by stainless steel and soft, sweeping balconies (Philadelphia.)
When the building was turned into a hotel, a lot of things were changed. The big bank room became a ballroom, and the offices were turned into hotel rooms, with a lot of executive suites. Everything was refurbished to once again reign as a center for business. It still stands as a huge player in the city's life, and will continue to do so, so long as people care about it (Yale.)

Prairie Style


The New York World Building, once undisputed for the tallest building in the world at 18 stories for four years, was built in 1889. It was designed by George B. Post, and was made in the image of the Renaissance Revival, and resided on 309 Park Row, just across from City Hall. While now demolished, this office building was one of the pride and joys of New York.
Its main features are its arched windows, impressive size and scale, doubled up center columns on each side, with a triangular pediment to crown it, along with its bold red sandstone, terra cotta, and brick exterior. It even had a dome to top it off with a gold finish (Tucker.)
Designed by Lloyd Wright in 1908, the Robie House resides in the South Side of Chicago and is a perfect example of the Prairie Style. Its horizontal lines, knee wall, flat roof, windows in a straight line, and overall appearance make it “blend” into the landscape, providing for a private, simple look based on function (Robie.)
Skyscrapers were created due to the growing populus. Spreading and sprawling out across the landscape was not enough; people needed buildings to go up! So, many architects got together, building better, sturdier buildings. One of these buildings was the New York World Building, along with several others that popped up. Unfortunately, the building was cut down to make room for the Brooklyn Bridge later on, so while it's claim to fame was once well known, it is now lost, and shown only in the pages of history (Tucker.)
Construction started on October 10th, 1889, and was finished December 10th, 1890. It was commissioned by Joseph Pulitzer, and was also named Pulitzer Building. Pulitzer's office was at the top, in the dome area, putting him in a position of power and giving him a great view of Newspaper Row.
The lower part of the building and basement was used for the newspapers, and contained a lot of presses. The mid floors were used for copy editing, and the rest housed several tenants. All of this combined together to provide money for the building and surrounding area (Matlins.)
The Robie House was made in mind for someone who had plenty of money, which turned out very well for Wright. Robie was an architect, and an entrepreneur of several companies, including automobile and bicycle ones. Due to the nature of his work, it was necessary for him to have a three car garage, which was very rare during the time. It was also built near the University of Chicago---the school that his wife graduated from (Robie.)
The Prairie Style was meant to be a new style, something that didn't rely on the Greeks or the Romans to make it look great. It developed along with the Art and Crafts Movement in the late 19th Century, and focused on simple lines and function. Buildings in this style were meant to resemble the prairies—flat, wide, and expansive. They were also built with the intention of blending into the landscape so that nature could still be enjoyed. Some might have simply called the overall look “organic (Prairie.)”
The house itself is three stories. The French doors are secluded from any prying eyes on 58th street. The entrance is veiled behind a porch, which really allows for privacy. The brick made it so the home blended in with the scenery and gave it an earthy feel, perfect for the style (Robie.)
More and more people had begun to care about the environment; they questioned if the skyscrapers were really all that good for the populous in the long run. The rise of these skyscrapers brought many new challenges, but they also made people think about how to overcome problems, so there was more architectural growth. The more people that flocked to the cities, the more of a need there was for a balance of nature and mankind as well, so it was even more challenging for architects and residents alike. Places like Central Park slowed the growth of the concrete jungle, to a degree, but with the ever-growing economy, the progress could not be stopped.
The old raged against the young, and new ideas sprang forth. The wells of knowledge seemed to be flooded with too many of the same things, they cried. As the years rolled on, America continued to experience more architectural changes as commercial and residential buildings grew in style and function.

One of the first things that should be considered is the amount and type of materials available. If the right materials are not available, it makes it difficult to even put in certain features. Once the base materials are established and accounted for, plans can be made, and then the process of getting the materials can begin.
Many settlers during the colonial periods wanted a “taste of home.” In other words, colonists wanted a representation of their homeland. This lead to an amalgamation of styles known as “American Colonial Architecture, a fragmented architectural style defined by regional differences and united by a common period (AI.)”
The type of features that would be important would depend on where the colonists came from, as well as their economic and financial status. That said, the type of architectural form that would be in the top tier would be the very popular Georgian style. This style was based upon European architecture books and “focused on the design details for windows, doors, fireplaces, and molding elements, which were adopted or modified by the builder (Historic.)” Double-hung sash windows, an arched entrance, and a hip roof with a ridiculous amount of detail on the molding would be especially beautiful. This would be important in any building, regardless of the function, because the exterior would need to be uniform in terms of style.
An amazing example can be seen here: http://www.homebunch.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture-19l.jpg
While the exact location is not known, the classic features of the style can be seen with the white painted pillars, columns, and roof. The Eustachian/Roman roots of the style in of itself can easily be seen in the steps that lead up to the entrance, the short porch, and tallness of the building.
In the end, so long as the rule of thumb was followed with the style, any building could be built with this method.

Architecture always has its cultural influences. During the 16th Century, when the Spaniards began to settle in what is now known as Florida, they drew on the local Native American culture to create their dwellings. Much like the natives, they were simple huts, focusing on base homes as opposed to large homes like the future Georgian style. “Palm leaves were bound to long sticks, which were then attached to the wooden framework of the house, forming a curtain-like wall. The roof consisted of the same material and had only a small home serving as a chimney. The floor was no more than clay (H2G2).”


http://www.roofthatch.com/images/galleryimagepool-thumbs/english-thatch-wigwam-03.jpg


“Traditional American Indian architecture is vernacular in type, and the design, construction, and use of built environments incorporates shared values and traditions. Knowledge and skills regarding building materials, engineering, and fabrication techniques are perpetuated through oral tradition and learned experience. Religious practice and political order often influence the orientation of structures and their arrangement in meaningful clusters (Architecture.)”
Depending on the region, they were also built with “tanned and smoked bison [and] tipis hides (Architecture.)” They also used saplings, woven mats, grass, thatch, and slabs of bark in their homes. This can be seen here:


http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/a/images/AR007A.jpg


Essentially, the Native American culture focused on working with nature, and their homes were less structured than the early colonist homes. Most information about future colonists' homes was also based on books and intellectual knowledge as opposed to learning orally or via tradition. Things like pillars with the future Georgian style were something that the Native Americans did not have in their tents or huts, which were very mobile. This allowed the Native Americans to be on the move, as opposed to having to vacate more permanent homes when things became difficult.

                  * Be reliably consistent.
                  * Be able to be replicated by most people. (Nothing overly complicated with 2000 steps, ya'll!)
                  * Submitted on Discord via you, so I can screencap your name, and you must tag me so I can keep a log of it.
